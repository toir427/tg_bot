On a cold January night, Anna&rsquo;s stepmother <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>remarked<\/strong>, &ldquo;Your stepsister <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>desires <\/strong>flowers. Go and find some.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Anna wasn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>anxious <\/strong>to walk through the chilled <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>landscape<\/strong>. The cold air made her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>lungs <\/strong>burn. She walked at a slow <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>pace <\/strong>because of the snow. Soon she saw a group of people. It <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>consisted <\/strong>of twelve men. Anna told them about the flowers.<\/p><p>One of the man said they were the twelve months and that they would help Anna. January walked to her and made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>motion <\/strong>with his hand. The days of the month passed <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>rapidly <\/strong>until it was February&rsquo;s turn. February also made the month speed up. Then March made the sun <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>shine <\/strong>and flowers grew in the field.<\/p><p>Anna <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>loaded <\/strong>her basket with so many flowers that she could hardly <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>lift <\/strong>it. Then she gave a quick but <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>polite <\/strong>&ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to the twelve men and returned home. She was very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>eager <\/strong>to show her stepmother all the flowers. Back at the house, she <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>spilled <\/strong>the flowers onto the table. Then she told her stepmother about the twelve men. Anna&rsquo;s stepmother and stepsister went to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>seek <\/strong>the twelve months. Their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>intent <\/strong>was to ask for gifts. They looked and looked. They became very lost and never found their way home. Anna lived happily by herself.<\/p>",

The snow was so thick that my <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>boots<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sank<\/strong>. The air was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>silent<\/strong>. I looked at the beauty that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>surrounded <\/strong>me.

I was the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>senior <\/strong>explorer in my group, and I knew we needed proof of our climb. I took many pictures with my camera. I&rsquo;ll put them in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>frame <\/strong>and hang them.<\/p><p>On the mountain, the air was very cold. I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wrapped <\/strong>my coat around my body. I looked over the side of the mountaintop. From that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>angle<\/strong>, I saw the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>border <\/strong>of the clouds touch the rocks below. The snow was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>thick<\/strong>. It looked pure. There was no sign of modern life.

They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>debated <\/strong>with him: no one thought a bird could talk.

This <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>frustrated <\/strong>him very much. But he was not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>stupid<\/strong>, and he wanted to change things.<\/p><p>Then one day there was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>struggle <\/strong>for <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>authority <\/strong>in the kingdom. There was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>division <\/strong>of the people, and one group fought against another group to see which would <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>govern <\/strong>the kingdom. There was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>disorder <\/strong>in the kingdom. Bartelby ran away. He saw much fighting and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>destruction<\/strong>. Many people had nothing to eat; Bartelby decided to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>aid <\/strong>them. He would help them get food. But how?<\/p><p>Bartelby went to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>capital <\/strong>to find an answer. There, he met a man named Gilliam. A group of men <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>attempted <\/strong>to hurt Gilliam. Bartelby <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>defended<\/strong> him. Then, he gave Gilliam some food to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>relieve <\/strong>his hunger. After that, the two became friends. They took food from the rich and gave it to the poor.<\/p><p>Soon, other people <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>cooperated <\/strong>with them. Working together <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>anabled <\/strong>them to take more food, butt they only took food from people who had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>plenty<\/strong>, and they always gave it to those who had none. Because of this, Bartleby gained a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>reputation <\/strong>across the kingdom. Even today, many people <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>admire <\/strong>him for helping the poor.<\/p>",

Last year, I had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>unique <\/strong>chance to work with my uncle. Our job was to find old treasures for a school&rsquo;s history <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>foundation<\/strong>. He also hired a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>crew <\/strong>of students. They signed a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>contract <\/strong>to work with him. He was the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>boss<\/strong>. The place was strange, though. I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>dined <\/strong>on many things that I had never tasted before. They had an unusual <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>flavor<\/strong>.<\/p><p>We had been there about a month and hadn&rsquo;t found anything. One day, I began to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>dig <\/strong>in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>soil<\/strong>. The ground&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>layers <\/strong>got wetter. Soon I was digging in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>mud<\/strong>. My shovel began to get very heavy. It felt like it had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>doubled <\/strong>in weight because the ground had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>absorbed <\/strong>a lot of water.<\/p><p>Finally, I saw something in the mud. It was an old knife! The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>handle <\/strong>felt smooth in my hand. I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>elevated <\/strong>it so I could see it better. There was writing on it.<\/p><p>&ldquo;It says it will bring good luck,&rdquo; my uncle said with a smile. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you keep it?&rdquo;<\/p><p>I put it in my tent. The next day, we found many more things. There were pots, jewelry and weapons. My uncle <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>donated <\/strong>all of the things to a special <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>committee<\/strong>. Many newspapers wrote stories about it. It seemed the knife really did bring good luck!<\/p>",

It <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>shocked <\/strong>him to see a boy who had a strong <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>likeness <\/strong>to him. Sam soon <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>recovered<\/strong>. The other boy stared at him. Then he spoke. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;<\/p><p>He needed to be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>rational<\/strong>. But he couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>deny <\/strong>that he wanted to go. So he followed the boy to a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>chamber<\/strong>. &ldquo;I am Prince Bertram,&rdquo; the boy said.<\/p><p>Sam felt <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>shy <\/strong>talking to a prince. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sam.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Trade places with me.&rdquo; The prince said.<\/p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t.

Soon, Sam&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>perspective <\/strong>on being a prince changed. He spent most of his day signing royal <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>documents<\/strong>. At night, the prince&rsquo;s chamber was cold.

He was happy when the week ended. So was the prince.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how to do anything,&rdquo; the prince said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>relied <\/strong>on my servants to do everything for me.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;I think I like being a regular person,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;Being a prince isn&rsquo;t fun.&rdquo; So, they both returned to their normal positions and enjoyed their lives more than before.<\/p>",

Then I got a job as a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>junior<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>mechanic<\/strong>. My father <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>criticized <\/strong>me. He wanted me to run the farm. But I did not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>shift <\/strong>my plans.<\/p><p>Then I worked for the Detroit Auto Company. But I wanted to make cars using less <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>labor<\/strong>. That way, there would be fewer <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>expenses<\/strong>. I started the Ford Motor Company in 1903. At first, the company did not do well. But many people were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>betting <\/strong>on my success. I also had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>sincere<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>aim <\/strong>to make a car that anybody could buy.<\/p><p>Then, in 1908,1 introduced the Model-T in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>formal <\/strong>ceremony. It <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>confirmed <\/strong>that I was right: it was possible to build a car my way!<\/p><p>The Model T <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>differed <\/strong>from other vehicles. Workers could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>attach <\/strong>different parts for cars or trucks. This saved time. One Model T could be put together in 93 minutes. All of them had the same <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>classic <\/strong>design. They were all the same size and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>height<\/strong>. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>prime <\/strong>reason for doing this was to save money.<\/p><p>Over 19 years, I sold over 15 million Model Ts. This sent a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>signal <\/strong>to other companies. People would buy cars to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>commute <\/strong>to work if the price was low enough.<\/p>",

He was good at his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>profession<\/strong>, but he still had no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>joy<\/strong>. He visited a group of wise <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>monks<\/strong>.<\/p><p>When he got to the monks&rsquo; house, they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>greeted <\/strong>him and let him in. The monks asked the priest, &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; The priest said, &ldquo;I should be happy, but I am not. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; The wise monks <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>paused <\/strong>for a minute. Then one said, &ldquo;We are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>convinced <\/strong>of your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>faith<\/strong>. You are a very good priest. But to find joy, you have to do more. Above all, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>investigate <\/strong>the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>elements <\/strong>of your life that you love.&rdquo; The priest thought that this answer was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>odd<\/strong>, but he was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>curious<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The next day, the priest thought about his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>abilities<\/strong>. He got a few ideas, and he did not want to delay any longer. He liked to draw, so he made some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>cartoons<\/strong>. He also liked to write, so he started a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>diary<\/strong>. He was interested in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>agriculture<\/strong>, so he planted some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>grains<\/strong>. He made jam from berries. He made his own <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>labels <\/strong>to put on the jars of jam. He painted his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>ceiling<\/strong>. The priest learned something. It is not too hard to be happy after all. All one has to do is find things they like doing, and do them!<\/p>",

Water <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>poured <\/strong>into the mine. Everything was dark. Jeremy <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>stretched <\/strong>out and grabbed a piece of wood.

They were going to race from the barn to the farmer&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>garage<\/strong>. The barn and the garage were far apart. It would be a long race. The winner <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>qualified <\/strong>to win a bag full of apples as an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>award<\/strong>.<\/p><p>But the race did not start well. The cart with all the apples was not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>stable<\/strong>, and the animals had to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>repair <\/strong>it. Then the pup knocked over the apples. The pig yelled, &ldquo;We are going to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>slip<\/strong>! We must clean up this mess.&rdquo; The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>pup <\/strong>felt bad, and she began to cry. The dog gave her a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tissue<\/strong> to wipe her tears.<\/p><p>Then the race <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>resumed<\/strong>. But the duck tried to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>rob <\/strong>them and take all the apples. The cat said, &ldquo;I will have you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>arrested<\/strong>!&rdquo; The duck said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>convict <\/strong>me! You can&rsquo;t prove I took it.&rdquo; The race stopped yet again.<\/p><p>The animals tried to race one more time. Then they heard an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>alarm <\/strong>coming from the barn. There was a fire! They got <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>buckets <\/strong>of water to put out the fire. A <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>journalist <\/strong>came to write a story about the festival and the race. The horse told her, &ldquo;I am a special <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>breed <\/strong>of horse. I would have won the race easily.&rdquo; The pig said, &ldquo;It was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>somewhat <\/strong>hard to have the race. But we had fun.

Put more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>fuel <\/strong>in the tank!&rdquo; he said. His ship was very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>plain<\/strong>, but he never had a problem with it.<\/p><p>The second captain, William, was not serious. He had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>grand <\/strong>ship, and he loved having fun. His crew <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>amused <\/strong>him by singing and dancing. But his crew never fixed anything on the ship. They just wanted to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>surf<\/strong>.<\/p><p>One day, Thomas saw a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>hurricane <\/strong>ahead. He knew that his ship needed to turn around. But he was sure William did not see the storm. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>adjusted <\/strong>the dials on the radio and called his friend. Thomas said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hit the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>reef<\/strong>. It&rsquo;s made completely of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>coral<\/strong>. Turn around to ensure that you do not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>crash<\/strong>.&rdquo;<\/p><p>William said, &ldquo;We will go under the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>deck <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>shut <\/strong>the door. We will dance and sing until we are past the danger <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>zone<\/strong>.&rdquo;<\/p><p>When William&rsquo;s ship got to the hurricane, the wind blew it into the reef. The ship crashed, and water flowed below the deck. William&rsquo;s crew <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accused <\/strong>him of being a bad captain. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>loss <\/strong>of the ship taught William a lesson. There are times to have fun, but there are also times to be serious.<\/p>",

He cut a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>branch <\/strong>off of a tree and tied a line to it. He put a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>sharp <\/strong>hook on it and made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>tight <\/strong>knot. Then he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>whispered<\/strong>, &ldquo;Come here fish.&rdquo; Like magic, the fish bit the hook. He put them in a big <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>net <\/strong>and took them home to make big <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>pots <\/strong>of fish soup from them.<\/p><p>One day, another man walked up to him.

I will <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accompany <\/strong>you today.

The fisherman had beaten him by forty-seven!<\/p><p>George asked, &ldquo;How do you catch fish with only a branch and a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>bare <\/strong>line? I have many different <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sorts <\/strong>of tools.&rdquo; The fisherman told George, &ldquo;My <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>philosophy <\/strong>is simple.

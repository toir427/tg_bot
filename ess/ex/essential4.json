                    "story": "<p>Many people believe that chocolate originally came from Europe. However, chocolate, called the &ldquo;food of the gods,&rdquo; was first made in the Americas. The first chocolate was very different from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>contemporary <\/strong>chocolate.<\/p><p>Wild chocolate trees can grow easily in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>humid <\/strong>Amazon rain forest. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>Clusters <\/strong>of flowers growing on these trees turn to seeds. About 20 to 60 cacao beans can be found in the seeds. Cacao beans are the ingredient needed to create sweet, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>soothing<\/strong>, and delicious chocolate treats.<\/p><p>The Mayan and Aztec cultures both thought that chocolate trees were brought from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>paradise <\/strong>by gods. The Mayans and Aztecs used the beans from this <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>divine <\/strong>tree to create a special <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>beverage <\/strong>with a very pleasant <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>odor<\/strong>. Surprisingly, the Aztecs believed that it would be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>toxic <\/strong>to women and children.<\/p><p>In the 1500s, the Spanish explorer Cortes met the Aztecs. Cortes became quite interested in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>plantations <\/strong>where the Aztecs <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>cultivated<\/strong> chocolate trees. When he returned to Europe, he took cacao beans with him. He introduced the people of Spain to the Aztecs&rsquo; chocolate beverage.<\/p><p>Over the next 100 years or so, kings, queens, and members of the upper class enjoyed drinking chocolate. They enjoyed it even more once they learned to add sugar to the beverage! Soon, chocolate had spread all across Europe. New machines allowed chocolate makers to perfect their products and produce them at a very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>rapid<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>rate<\/strong>. Preparing the beans in special ways brought out the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>aroma <\/strong>of chocolate. The beans were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>combined <\/strong>with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>condensed <\/strong>milk to give the chocolate a smooth <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>texture<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Today, contemporary chocolates with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>subtle <\/strong>flavors fill the shelves of expensive chocolate shops. The different types of chocolate available today <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vary <\/strong>widely. True chocolate lovers can tell which is best, though. They will tell you that the flavor of high quality chocolate stays on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>palate <\/strong>long after you finish it.<\/p>",

But how did the monkeys get there?<\/p><p>Once, an English <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>admiral <\/strong>was exploring Africa when he found hundreds of monkeys. The admiral&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>character <\/strong>was mean. He thought, &ldquo;I could sell these monkeys and become very rich! I&rsquo;m going to take them to England.&rdquo;<\/p><p>So the admiral set traps to catch the monkeys. He put <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>stakes <\/strong>in the ground, tied string around them and made loops in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>string<\/strong>. When the monkeys ran through the forest, their feet got caught in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>loops<\/strong>, and they couldn&rsquo;t escape. Then the admiral put the monkeys in cages on his ship and sailed away.<\/p><p>The cages were small and uncomfortable. There was no soft <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>hay <\/strong>for the monkeys to sleep on. Instead, they slept on branches with sharp <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>thorns <\/strong>that cut into the monkeys&rsquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>flesh<\/strong>. For dinner, he gave them tiny pieces of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sour<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>grapefruit <\/strong>to eat. The monkeys grew hungry and weak.<\/p><p>But one day, the admiral hired a new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>steward<\/strong>. He was a kind man with a good <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>conscience<\/strong>. He was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>horrified <\/strong>to see the thin monkeys in the cages. So one night he let them out.<\/p><p>The monkeys ran and played all over the ship! They attacked the admiral and the steward and ate their food. They completely <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wrecked <\/strong>the ship. One monkey ran into a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>kerosene <\/strong>lamp, and it fell over. The ship caught fire and began to sink! The whole crew was lost except for the monkeys.<\/p><p>After the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accident<\/strong>, the monkeys jumped onto a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>raft<\/strong>. They floated away from the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>fiery <\/strong>blaze of the ship. In the morning, they saw a little island in the distance. The monkeys used a piece of wood as a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>paddle<\/strong>, and they went toward it. They found the island shaped like an arc. They felt so happy to find a new home, and they still live there today.<\/p>",

He heard about people hiking in the national parks and decided to try it for himself. As he started his stroll, an old man walked up to him.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go this way,&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;<strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>Beware<\/strong>. The paths are not clear. It&rsquo;s easy to become lost.&rdquo;<\/p><p>But the young man <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>disagreed <\/strong>with the old man and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>bragged <\/strong>that he had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>perfect <\/strong>understanding of the park. &ldquo;I studied maps of this area,&rdquo; he told him. &ldquo;I believe I have a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>thorough <\/strong>knowledge of these trails. I won&rsquo;t become lost.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The old man listened to the young man and then <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>admonished <\/strong>him for his pride.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I have walked these trails my entire life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you think you will be safe, then go ahead.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The young man ignored the old man and started along the trail.<\/p><p>Whenever he had to choose between an easy or difficult route, he always chose the more difficult <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>option<\/strong>. In addition, he was not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>conscious <\/strong>of which direction he was going. After a while, he decided to return home. Because his course through the wilderness was so <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>indirect<\/strong>, he had no idea where he was.<\/p><p>He looked at his map but could not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>pinpoint <\/strong>his location. He walked one path after another but soon realized he was lost.<\/p><p>The sun was going down, and sudden strong winds gave a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>hint <\/strong>that it might rain. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>Immense <\/strong>clouds filled the sky. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>Awesome <\/strong>sounds of thunder were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>audible <\/strong>from all directions.

The thought of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>eventual <\/strong>storm <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tormented <\/strong>the young man. He hurried in one direction, but soon <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>switched <\/strong>out of confusion. Luckily, it led him out of the park.<\/p><p>When he arrived home, he knew that he had acted like an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>idiot<\/strong>. He realized he was lucky to be alive.

One day, he used the sharp <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>rim <\/strong>of a bottle to dig a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>pit <\/strong>in the ground. He hid in a tree until Rabbit came to the pit&rsquo;s edge. Then, he jumped out and pushed Rabbit into the pit. Fox laughed and ran away. The angry Rabbit climbed out and told the other animals what happened.<\/p><p>The others said, &ldquo;That is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>typical <\/strong>behavior for Fox. He does mean things all the time. Sometimes, he is completely <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>immoral<\/strong>. We all <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>disapprove<\/strong> of his actions, so we should teach him a lesson. Tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll push Fox into that pit.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The next day, all of the animals hid near the pit and waited for Fox. Fox was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>oblivious <\/strong>to the hidden animals. He walked up to the pit to see if Rabbit was still trapped. Just then, the other animals ran up to Fox and pushed him in. All the animals laughed and cheered, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>except <\/strong>Fox, of course.<\/p><p>Fox couldn&rsquo;t get out! The walls of the pit were covered in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>damp<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>ivy<\/strong>. It was too <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>slippery <\/strong>for him to climb out. He was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>utterly <\/strong>helpless. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>moaned <\/strong>and began to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>weep<\/strong>.<\/p><p>At last, he saw Eagle watching him from her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>roost<\/strong>. He yelled, &ldquo;Eagle, please help me! If I don&rsquo;t get out of here, I will <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>perish<\/strong>!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Eagle said, &ldquo;You may think your tricks are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>trivial<\/strong>, but you hurt others when you do mean things. I&rsquo;ll help you if you promise to be nice.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Fox said, &ldquo;I promise!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Eagle began her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>flight <\/strong>to the bottom of the pit. She picked up Fox with her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>beak <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>soared <\/strong>out of the pit. She dropped Fox safely on the ground.<\/p><p>Fox thanked Eagle and kept his promise. He was nice to the other animals. The animals even became <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>fond <\/strong>of Fox, and the forest was happy place.<\/p>",

The essay was complete! Had somebody in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>cyberspace <\/strong>written it? I didn&rsquo;t know, but I was very happy. I printed it out and handed it in. I got an &ldquo;A.&rdquo;<\/p><p>After that, I used the computer for all my assignments. I&rsquo;d type the title, wait <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>awhile<\/strong>, and the computer would do it. Every assignment was perfect; I never had to edit anything. I stopped paying attention to my teacher&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>lectures <\/strong>and spent my extra time in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>gymnasium<\/strong>. And my grades got better and better.<\/p><p>A month later, I was walking into class when my friend said, &ldquo;Are you prepared for the test?&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;What test?&rdquo; I asked.<\/p><p>&ldquo;The geography test!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I hope you studied. It&rsquo;s worth seventy percent of our final grade!&rdquo;<\/p><p>I failed the test, of course. I was completely <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>ignorant <\/strong>about the subject. After that, I made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>resolution <\/strong>never to use the magic computer again. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>moral <\/strong>of this story is that if you cheat at school, you won&rsquo;t learn anything.<\/p>",

He wears a white <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>cape<\/strong>, and his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>role <\/strong>is to cover everything with frost and ice. But Jack Frost also gets <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>pleasure <\/strong>from playing tricks on common <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>folks<\/strong>.<\/p><p>One dark winter evening, he was sitting on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>rail <\/strong>of a fence near a river, pointing at some trees. When he did so, there was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>pop<\/strong>, and the trees were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>evenly <\/strong>covered in frost.<\/p><p>Then old Tom Muggins came along the path. He was carrying a basket of ingredients for his wife&rsquo;s cake <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>recipe<\/strong>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have some fun with him!&rdquo; said Jack Frost. He pointed, and suddenly there was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>patch<\/strong> of ice on the path. Poor Tom slipped and fell into the river. The bags of flour, fruit and sugar fell open and got wet. A couple of eggs broke, and a stick of butter <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>shrank <\/strong>in the water. Tom gathered the ingredients and climbed out of the river. The food made an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>absolute <\/strong>mess of the path. &ldquo;<strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>Alas<\/strong>!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no cake for me!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Jack Frost laughed at poor Tom because his nice <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>suit <\/strong>got <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>soaked <\/strong>as well. &ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll make you warm!&rdquo; He pointed at the mess in Tom&rsquo;s basket. Suddenly, there was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>spark<\/strong>. What was left of the food caught fire! Jack Frost ran off laughing.<\/p><p>Poor Tom sat by the fire. He could only <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>envision <\/strong>how angry his wife would be. He wished he had been more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>attentive <\/strong>and noticed that Jack was around.<\/p><p>Suddenly, a pleasant smell came from the basket. Tom looked inside. The butter was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>melting <\/strong>and the eggs were starting to cook! Even the fruit began to simmer. Soon there was a fat, brown <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>pudding <\/strong>in the basket! Tom tasted it. It was delicious! He happily took it home for dessert. Although Jack Frost had tried to make Tom&rsquo;s life difficult, Jack had actually made Tom a wonderful pudding!<\/p>",

He planned to cut down the trees to make room for the building. But there was a problem ... a big problem.<\/p><p>The land was actually the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>habitat <\/strong>of several types of birds. Some nature lovers were very upset with the architect. First, they held a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>rally <\/strong>and told others about the issue. Then, they decided to take <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>legal <\/strong>action because the architect didn&rsquo;t respect the animals&rsquo; rights.<\/p><p>To <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>resolve <\/strong>the problem, they asked a judge to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>intervene<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The judge could not call any <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>witnesses <\/strong>for the nature lovers, so he first asked the architect to tell his side of the story.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Why are you going to destroy the birds&rsquo; habitat?&rdquo; the judge asked.<\/p><p>The architect replied, &ldquo;I have the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>deed <\/strong>to the land. I want to make a great building there. As you may know, all my buildings become <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>memorable<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>landmarks<\/strong>.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Then one of the nature lovers spoke. &ldquo;We believe that there&rsquo;s no reason to destroy all the trees. We just want to protect the birds.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Then the judge made his decision. &ldquo;I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>proclaim <\/strong>that the office building should be built,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is not a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>crime <\/strong>to remove those trees. I cannot give you a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>sentence <\/strong>for any <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>offenses<\/strong>, but I feel <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>obliged <\/strong>to make one request. I will only allow you to use half of the land. The other half will remain free, so the birds have a place to live.<\/p><p>The nature lovers could not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>conceal <\/strong>their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>gratitude<\/strong>. All of the people cheered.<\/p><p>The architect said, &ldquo;I have an idea. I will <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>volunteer <\/strong>my time and efforts to design a new type of building. It will provide bushes on the roof where birds can live. There are enough <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>resources <\/strong>in my company&rsquo;s bank <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>account <\/strong>to create the best building ever made.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The architect did exactly as he promised.

She hurried down the hall but <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>halted <\/strong>when she saw a backpack on the floor. She looked inside and found nothing but some books. She reached inside the bag and felt a small object at the bottom. It was a music player <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>enclosed <\/strong>in a black case! Janie <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>tended <\/strong>to be honest, and she had no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>valid <\/strong>reason to take the device. However, her desire for the player <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>influenced <\/strong>her decision. Janie was being <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sly<\/strong>. She put the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>device <\/strong>into her own backpack. When she arrived at class, she gave her teacher the bag. &ldquo;I found this,&rdquo; she said.<\/p><p>Ms. Johnson asked, &ldquo;Does this backpack belong to anyone?&rdquo; A girl named Linda claimed the bag. Linda looked inside and yelled, &ldquo;My music player is missing! Janie took it!&rdquo; Janie answered, &ldquo;I did not.&rdquo; Linda responded, &ldquo;You were the only one that had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>access <\/strong>to it! If your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>version <\/strong>of the story is true, you&rsquo;ll let Ms. Johnson check your bag.&rdquo; Janie started to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>perspire <\/strong>as she realized the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>impending <\/strong>trouble she was in. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>gripped <\/strong>her bag tightly.<\/p><p>Ms. Johnson took the bag from Janie. Inside she found the player. &ldquo;Janie, I never expected this kind of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>conduct <\/strong>from you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been such a good student.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Ms. Johnson gave Linda the player. Linda said, &ldquo;Ms. Johnson, look!&rdquo; There was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>crack <\/strong>along one side. She turned it to the &ldquo;on&rdquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>mode<\/strong>, but it wouldn&rsquo;t work. It must&rsquo;ve <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>snapped <\/strong>while Janie was holding onto the bag so tightly.<\/p><p>Ms. Johnson called Janie&rsquo;s parents. They were very upset. &ldquo;Stealing is illegal. You have no respect for the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>law<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>whatsoever<\/strong>,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We bought you a music player, but we&rsquo;re giving it to Linda. It will <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>replace <\/strong>the one you broke.&rdquo; In the end, Janie&rsquo;s bad behavior left herwith nothing at all.<\/p>",

Many bad things could have happened to George, but he was lucky. He was sent to live <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>alongside <\/strong>other children without parents. There were kind people to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>assist <\/strong>George and help him go forward with his life. However, he was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pessimistic <\/strong>and mean little boy.<\/p><p>George was often <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>outraged<\/strong>. He told mean rumors about the other kids. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>smashed <\/strong>furniture and even <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>slapped <\/strong>other boys. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>defied <\/strong>anyone who tried to help him, and soon it was difficult for them to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>forgive <\/strong>him. But George did <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>display <\/strong>a love for one thing. He loved to play baseball. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>Whereas <\/strong>he was lazy in school and liked neither the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>subjects<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>nor <\/strong>the teachers, he was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>lively <\/strong>and happy when he played baseball.<\/p><p>One of George&rsquo;s teachers noticed his talent. He began to work with the boy. At first - &bull; they only talked about baseball. The teacher watched George play. He was a very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>efficient <\/strong>hitter. He almost never missed the ball. The teacher thought that George looked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>majestic <\/strong>when he played. When George hit the ball, it flew through the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>breeze <\/strong>as if it would never come down. In time, they began to talk about other things. They talked about George&rsquo;s 3 family and his dreams for the future. They developed a very good relationship.<\/p><p>As George got older, he began to grow. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>appetite <\/strong>was huge. He ate and ate. He got stronger. Soon the other boys and even the teachers looked small and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>feeble <\/strong>next to him. Everyone thought that this heralded the start of a great baseball career.<\/p><p>When George got his first job as a baseball player, he gave most of his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>wages <\/strong>to the people who had helped him as a boy. He hoped that other children would also find a way to live happy, successful lives.<\/p>",

                    "story": "<p>Anton Van Leeuwenhoek was a Dutch cloth merchant. His life began to change after he got his first microscope in 1653. It was a very simple microscope. It had a lens in an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>upright <\/strong>stand. It could make small things look large. It was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>handy <\/strong>for looking closely at cloth.<\/p><p>Soon, Anton felt a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>longing <\/strong>to build a more powerful microscope. He dreamed of using it to make an important scientific discovery. He wanted to become famous. Three <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>decades <\/strong>later, he did.<\/p><p>For many years, Anton experimented with microscopes and lenses. Eventually he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>constructed <\/strong>a very powerful microscope. If he had sold the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>concept <\/strong>to others, it would have made him very rich. However, Anton <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>refrained <\/strong>from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>surrendering <\/strong>his secret to anyone. Instead, he wanted to use it to become famous. So he used his secret microscope to study the natural world.<\/p><p>One day he was looking at saliva from his mouth with the microscope. In the saliva, he saw <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>numerous <\/strong>tiny <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>particles<\/strong>. Some of them were moving! He thought that the particles were tiny organisms. So he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>isolated <\/strong>them from each other and studied each one carefully. Then he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>classified <\/strong>them into different categories. Some were round. Others were long and had tails. All were alive.<\/p><p>Anton was so excited. He knew he could become famous now. He was the first person to see these tiny organisms. So he drew <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>diagrams <\/strong>of the organisms and sent them to a group of scientists in London. The scientists were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>sophisticated <\/strong>men who did not believe tiny, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>animate <\/strong>organisms could live in our mouths. Anton made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>plea <\/strong>for them to come to Holland to see the organisms with their own eyes. The men took a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>ferry <\/strong>to Holland and met Anton. They performed a careful <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>review <\/strong>of his work, and they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>conceded <\/strong>that he had made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>worthwhile <\/strong>discovery. Anton Van Leeuwenhoek had discovered bacteria. After decades of hard work, he had become famous.<\/p>",

But Josephine Baker was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>exception<\/strong>. In the 1930s and 1940s, Baker was one of the most famous women in France. She was a big part of the new jazz <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>genre <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>culture <\/strong>and had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>diverse <\/strong>group of fans. The French people especially loved her. And she loved France. So when World War II started, she wanted to help the nation that had given her so much.<\/p><p>In 1940, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>armed <\/strong>German troops entered Paris. When this happened, some French people formed a secret <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>alliance<\/strong>. It was called the French Resistance. The group worked for the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>defense <\/strong>of France. It helped the European and American armies fight the Germans.<\/p><p>Baker was an important member of the Resistance. She had three jobs. The first was to carry messages to and from other members. The messages were written in code on her sheets of music. The second was to provide <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>shelter <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>supply <\/strong>goods to Resistance members. It would have been dangerous if the Germans found them.<\/p><p>Baker&rsquo;s third job was the most important. Baker held concerts for European politicians and army members. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>lured <\/strong>them in, promising an entertaining show. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>enchanted <\/strong>them with her singing and dancing and got lots of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>applause<\/strong>. But Baker was always <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>equipped <\/strong>with a small notebook at these concerts. She listened for <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>details <\/strong>about the war and wrote them down. Baker <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>sorted <\/strong>the details and gave <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>authoritative<\/strong> reports to the Resistance.<\/p><p>Some thought Baker&rsquo;s fame would be an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>obstacle<\/strong>. The Germans knew who she was, but they didn&rsquo;t think she was smart enough to work for the Resistance. So she could get information from the Germans easily. This helped the Resistance and the French army save lives and win the war.<\/p><p>Baker had a big <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>impact <\/strong>on the Resistance&rsquo;s work. She got many awards for her help. When she died, the army had a special <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>ceremony <\/strong>to thank her again for her bravery.<\/p>",

Just before he reached the finish line, he fell. Alex thought that it was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>subconscious <\/strong>way that his brain was trying to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>warn <\/strong>him about something. He was going to run in a race that day. Did the dream mean he was going to lose? He became <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>irritable<\/strong>.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Alex&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>brewed <\/strong>some coffee and made you a special breakfast.&rdquo; Alex didn&rsquo;t want it. It had too much sugar. He needed something <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>nutritious<\/strong>. So he prepared a meal that contained a lot of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>protein <\/strong>to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>maximize <\/strong>his energy for the race. Then his father asked, &ldquo;Do you want help packing your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>stuff<\/strong>?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Alex. He wanted to make sure that he had all of his equipment for the race.<\/p><p>Alex&rsquo;s family got in their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>van <\/strong>and drove to the track. When they arrived, a boy ran toward Alex. &ldquo;Can I have your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>autograph<\/strong>?&rdquo; asked the boy. Alex had many fans. He usually <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>charmed <\/strong>everybody he spoke to. However, today Alex refused to give the boy his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>signature<\/strong>. He needed to think about his race.<\/p><p>He took his jump rope from his bag and started his usual <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>workout<\/strong>. Maybe exercising would help him forget about the nightmare. &ldquo;The race is about to start,&rdquo; said the coach. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>Beads <\/strong>of sweat formed out of Alex&rsquo;s sweat glands. All he could think about was his terrible dream. He thought it might be his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>destiny <\/strong>to become a loser. While he was thinking, he didn&rsquo;t hear the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>horn <\/strong>that meant the race had started.<\/p><p>The runners <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>zoomed <\/strong>toward the finish line. By the time Alex started, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>lagged <\/strong>far behind everyone. He couldn&rsquo;t run fast enough to catch up to the others. He had lost the race! He shouldn&rsquo;t have let the nightmare <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>affect <\/strong>him. He should have stayed focused on the race.<\/p>",

The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>dough <\/strong>needed to be soft and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>flexible<\/strong>, but the salt made it into a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>lump <\/strong>that was as hard as a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>brick<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The younger brother <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>uttered <\/strong>a sigh. &ldquo;Now we have to start again,&rdquo; he said.<\/p><p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the older brother replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it.

The dough then crashed into the kitchen window&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>shutters <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>crumbled<\/strong>. Luckily, the brothers were not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>injured<\/strong>, but they did make a huge mess.<\/p><p>A <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>slight <\/strong>mistake now became a major problem.

Laika was a little dog living on the streets of Moscow, Russia. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>matured<\/strong> on the streets because no one would give her a home. She had to learn how to live without eating much. She found ways to keep warm in a very cold <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>climate<\/strong>. Scientists thought a tough dog like Laika would do well in a project they were putting together.<\/p><p>In a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>prior <\/strong>launch, Russia had put the first man-made object into space. Now, scientists wanted to see if a living thing could go to space. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>Although<\/strong> many facts about space had been learned, they weren&rsquo;t enough to help send humans to space safely.<\/p><p>Laika and two other dogs were chosen to help scientists with their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>research<\/strong>. The animals were used in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>variety <\/strong>of tests. In the end, though, only Laika would go to space. On November 3,1957 the Sputnik 2 spaceship was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>due <\/strong>to leave Earth.<\/p><p>Scientists carefully <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>applied <\/strong>wires to Laika&rsquo;s skin to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>measure <\/strong>her body&rsquo;s reactions once she got into space. Laika also wore a special <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>leash<\/strong>. Without it, she would float around in the spaceship. Soon after, Laika left the planet. Scientists on Earth <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>awaited <\/strong>information from the ship.<\/p><p>But in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>midst <\/strong>of so much excitement, something very sad happened. Scientists were able to tell that Laika was under a lot of stress. The trip <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>confused <\/strong>and scared her. Laika&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>entire <\/strong>ship had become as hot as a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>furnace<\/strong>. Scientists were powerless to help the dog in her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>misery<\/strong>. After about five hours, Laika died.<\/p><p>Some have <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>complained <\/strong>that the little dog should never have been used in the mission. Scientists knew that she would not survive the trip. Laika was never <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>buried<\/strong>, but a memorial has been <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>established <\/strong>in Moscow. There are many songs and books about her, too. It seems that Laika became a hero to many people.<\/p>",

That weekend, they drove to Estes Park. When they arrived, Kara looked around. She felt so far from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>civilization<\/strong>.<\/p><p>After they set up the camp, they went for a walk. Tracy&rsquo;s father, Mr. Grieves, showed them the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>native <\/strong>plants and animals. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a fox&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>den<\/strong>. Do you see that bunch of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>mushrooms <\/strong>next to it. Don&rsquo;t touch them. They contain <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>poison<\/strong>.&rdquo; Kara was bored. She didn&rsquo;t care about nature.<\/p><p>As the day went on, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>mighty <\/strong>clouds soon <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>loomed <\/strong>in the distance. &ldquo;It looks like <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>stormy <\/strong>weather,&rdquo; said Tracy. &ldquo;We should go back.&rdquo; It suddnely began to rain. They used an umbrella to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>shield <\/strong>them from the rain. Back at the camp, they ate cold sandwiches for dinner and went to sleep.<\/p><p>By morning, the rain had stopped. It was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>drastic <\/strong>change from the previous day&rsquo;s weather. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>folded <\/strong>their sleeping bags and put them in a box. Tracy closed the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>lid <\/strong>and told Kara, &ldquo;Today will be fun, I promise!&rdquo; Kara didn&rsquo;t believe her. She missed her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>convenient <\/strong>life in the city. She was used to an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>urban <\/strong>lifestyle.<\/p><p>After breakfast, they went for a walk. The grass was covered with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>dew<\/strong>, and it gleamed in the sunlight. Finally, they reached a lake. Kara and Tracy <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>waded <\/strong>into the water. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>reeds<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>swayed <\/strong>in the wind, and a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>flock <\/strong>of birds flew above. Kara felt very peaceful.<\/p><p>That night, they made a fire. They sat around it while Mr. Grieves told scary stories. Kara had a lot of fun. Camping was a good way for friends to spend time together, she realized.<\/p><p>The next day, it was time for them to leave. She felt sad while they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>exited <\/strong>the park. She didn&rsquo;t like camping at first, but she learned how fun it could be over the weekend.<\/p>",

He was sure he would get the lead role.<\/p><p>Later, his friend Robby asked him, &ldquo;Have you seen the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>script <\/strong>for the play?&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Yes. The title is The Lost <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>Glove<\/strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>comic <\/strong>play,&rdquo; replied Peter.<\/p><p>Robby said, &ldquo;I want to play the part of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>hermit <\/strong>because the hermit gets to talk with an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accent<\/strong>!&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;I want the lead role of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>barber<\/strong>. I didn&rsquo;t know you liked acting. I thought you liked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>choir <\/strong>better,&rdquo; said Peter.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Acting is also a hobby of mine. Do you want to practice with me? The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>basement <\/strong>at my house is quiet. It&rsquo;s perfect!&rdquo; Robby replied.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like practicing with others. It <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>complicates <\/strong>the process for me,&rdquo; said Peter.<\/p><p>Actually, Peter didn&rsquo;t want to practice at all. The teacher would surely <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>reserve <\/strong>the lead part for him. A few days later, Robby came to his house.<\/p><p>Robby said, &ldquo;Do you want to practice the scene on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>staircase<\/strong>? It&rsquo;s the part where the migrant <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>searches <\/strong>for a new job.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Peter <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>declined <\/strong>the invitation. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t today. I need to do some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>errands<\/strong>.&rdquo; Then he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>slammed <\/strong>the door. It was just an excuse. Peter didn&rsquo;t want to help Robby.<\/p><p>On the day of auditions, Peter wore his lucky <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>leather <\/strong>jacket. He always got the best part when he wore it. The teacher told him to begin, but his mind was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>blank<\/strong>. He couldn&rsquo;t remember the lines!<\/p><p>A week later, the teacher put a list of the parts on the wall. Peter read the list, looking for his name. He was shocked by what he saw. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>blinked <\/strong>his eyes and looked again. He didn&rsquo;t get the lead part&mdash;Robby did! Peter <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>pondered <\/strong>the situation and came to the idea that Robby <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>justly <\/strong>received the part. He earned it by practicing. Next time, Peter would practice, too.<\/p>",

He was scared that his plane would have a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>breakdown<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Isaac got onto the plane. He walked down the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>aisle <\/strong>until he found his seat. He sat down and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>connected <\/strong>the ends of his seat belt. After being <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>idle <\/strong>for a few minutes, the pilot announced that they were ready to leave.<\/p><p>He looked out the window at the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>vivid <\/strong>colors of the sky. He began to feel scared. The girl sitting next to him said, &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Rachel! You look nervous, but you don&rsquo;t need to be. Flying is fun!&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still a bit nervous,&rdquo; Issac said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m getting hungry.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;The food service will begin soon. Just lower the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>tray <\/strong>on the seat in front of you, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>flip <\/strong>this switch. Then they&rsquo;ll bring your dinner! Last time, they served chicken, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>peas<\/strong>, and a box of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>raisins<\/strong>,&rdquo; Rachel explained.<\/p><p>Then the pilot <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>notified <\/strong>the passengers of bad conditions in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>atmosphere<\/strong>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re tracking the weather: lightning, clouds, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>etc.<\/strong> The ride might get a bit rough,&rdquo; he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>stated<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Suddenly, the plane started to shake. Isaac was badly <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>afflicted <\/strong>by his fear. His stomach hurt, and he thought he might <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vomit<\/strong>. He couldn&rsquo;t believe that he was in such an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>unfortunate <\/strong>place. Finally, the shaking stopped. Isaac was still scared, but he tried to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>retain <\/strong>a good attitude.<\/p><p>&ldquo;The first time I flew, the plane shook so bad that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>cargo <\/strong>started falling. My parents told me to listen to music and read a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>chapter <\/strong>in my book. It calmed me,&rdquo; Rachel said.<\/p><p>Suddenly, the plane shook again. This time, Isaac followed Rachel&rsquo;s advice. He put on headphones and took out a book by his favorite <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>author<\/strong>. The book and the music helped Isaac feel better. After a while, he didn&rsquo;t even notice the bad weather. The bad situation didn&rsquo;t feel so bad after someone helped him.<\/p>",

The king had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>founded <\/strong>a great empire, but his land was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>rife <\/strong>with enemies who wanted to take over the kingdom. Because there was so much <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>civil <\/strong>unrest, the king told Clara not to trust anyone.<\/p><p>One day, Clara was walking outside when she saw a girl <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>sweeping <\/strong>the path. Clara <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>crossed <\/strong>the garden, and they started talking. The girl&rsquo;s name was Susie. Clara felt sorry for Susie because she was very poor, and Clara gave her a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bracelet<\/strong>. After that, Susie and Clara met every day.<\/p><p>Once, the King saw them talking. He told Clara, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to that girl. She could be an enemy.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>distrust <\/strong>everyone,&rdquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>commented <\/strong>Clara. &ldquo;She is my <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>sole <\/strong>friend. It&rsquo;s OK to be friendly to people.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The King said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue with me. Stay inside from now on, and talk to no one.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Clara felt lonely in the fort. But one day she saw Susie outside. She wrote her a note with a map showing a secret entrance to the fort. Clara wrote: &ldquo;Come at night, and we can talk together. Don&rsquo;t show anybody this note.&rdquo; She threw the note to Susie, and Susie <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tucked <\/strong>it in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>lining <\/strong>of her dress.<\/p><p>That night Clara waited for Susie. But she heard something ticking, and then a loud <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>blast<\/strong>. She ran into the hall, and it was full of smoke, which made her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>choke<\/strong>. A <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>mass <\/strong>of soldiers were there, fighting. Clara realized that Susie had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>betrayed <\/strong>her and given the map to her father&rsquo;s enemies. Clara <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>prayed <\/strong>that everyone in the castle would be safe from her friend&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>treachery<\/strong>.<\/p><p>At last, the fighting <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>ceased<\/strong>. Clara found her father in the hall with his soldiers. They had defeated their enemies, but there were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>dents <\/strong>in their armor from the heavy fighting. Clara told her father what she had done and promised never to disobey him again.<\/p>",

The coins were left as <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>bait <\/strong>for the robbers. When they touched the coins, the venom <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>infected <\/strong>their bodies through their skin. The venom ran through their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>veins<\/strong>, and they all became very sick as if they had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>disease<\/strong>. It made their skin purple. The police arrested whoever had purple skin.<\/p><p>She knew she couldn&rsquo;t use venom because it might hurt someone. However, she thought of a way to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>update <\/strong>the old story. She decided to cover a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>sum <\/strong>of money with a special powder. If people touched the money, the powder would cause their skin to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>itch<\/strong>. She placed the stack of money in the bank&rsquo;s safe. No one was supposed to take money from the safe. If somebody did, then they had to be stealing.<\/p><p>Within a few hours, three of her coworkers were scratching their hands and arms. They itched so badly that they couldn&rsquo;t even work. She checked the money, and it was gone. She told her boss what she had done, and he had the thieves arrested. He thanked her and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>promoted <\/strong>her.<\/p><p>Because events from history often repeat, ancient literature had helped the teller solve a crime. She proved that stories from the past still <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>relate<\/strong> with the problems of today, and they can be helpful in solving problems.<\/p>",

However, the empire had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>depleted <\/strong>many of the forests. The trees were important to the western areas&rsquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>economy<\/strong>. With no trees to sell, the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>commerce <\/strong>in that area was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>reduced<\/strong>. Citizens could no longer purchase the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>goods <\/strong>that they needed to survive. Their life became difficult.<\/p><p>A poor <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>scribe <\/strong>from the area wanted to help. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>hitchhiked <\/strong>to the capital to ask the emperor for <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>charity<\/strong>. He was invited to the palace. It was large and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>cozy<\/strong>. Tables were loaded with food, and fires burned warmly in every fireplace.<\/p><p>The emperor sat up upon his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>throne<\/strong>, and the scribe stood in front of him.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to ask for help,&rdquo; the scribe said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all very poor and hungry. You&rsquo;ve used up all of the forests, and now we have nothing to sell.&rdquo; Then he added a warning. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t receive help, I&rsquo;m afraid that the entire empire will suffer. We must establish some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>unity<\/strong>.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Upon hearing the scribe&rsquo;s request, the emperor&rsquo;s bad <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>temper <\/strong>surfaced. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>mocked <\/strong>the scribe. &ldquo;You think I should help,&rdquo; he said and laughed. &ldquo;You should just be happy to belong to this great empire. You will get nothing from me.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The emperor felt no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pity <\/strong>for the citizens of the western area. They were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>condemned <\/strong>to starve. The scribe returned home with nothing.<\/p><p>Not long after, an enemy invaded the empire from the west. They were marching to the capital. Because the citizens felt <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>persecuted <\/strong>by the emperor, they remained <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>neutral<\/strong>. They didn&rsquo;t fight the invaders but allowed them to march freely to the capital.<\/p><p>The emperor was defeated. If he had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>heeded <\/strong>the words of the scribe, then the citizens might have been the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>victors<\/strong>. But because he had treated them badly, they treated him badly in return.<\/p>",

                    "story": "<p>Many scientists and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>intellectuals <\/strong>think that dinosaurs died when an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>asteroid <\/strong>smashed into the Earth millions of years ago. However, recently, there has been some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>controversy <\/strong>over this theory. Some scientists think that it isn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accurate<\/strong>. They think that a tiny insect may have been the biggest <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>factor <\/strong>in the death of these huge creatures. That insect was the mosquito.<\/p><p>These scientists do think that an asteroid hit the Earth the time of the dinosaurs. But that wasn&rsquo;t what killed all of them. At that time, insects, including the mosquito, were beginning to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>evolve<\/strong>. Today, we can <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>regulate <\/strong>the number of mosquitoes with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>pesticides<\/strong>. But that was impossible millions of years ago. The mosquitoes <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>multiplied <\/strong>quickly. And they were certainly not idle. Since there were so many mosquitoes, it was easy for them to bite many of the dinosaurs. When they bit another living thing, the mosquitoes passed along a deadly disease. So the dinosaurs were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>stricken <\/strong>with the disease. A <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>vast<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>majority <\/strong>of them, from the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vegetarians <\/strong>to the meat eaters, died.<\/p><p>To <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>reinforce <\/strong>this idea, scientists stress how gradually the dinosaurs died. If an asteroid killed them, they would have died very quickly. But the number of dinosaurs decreased slowly. In addition, scientists have found <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>genetic <\/strong>material of mosquitoes in fossils. This material proves that mosquitoes existed back then. Although there may have been other factors, the dinosaurs died mainly because of disease, the scientists say.<\/p><p>No matter how it happened, the dinosaurs&rsquo; death had a major impact on other living things. Many dinosaurs ate <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>mammals<\/strong>. After the dinosaurs died, mammals were able to evolve and produce <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>offspring<\/strong>. Birds also evolved. Scientists have <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>analyzed <\/strong>the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>genomes <\/strong>of birds, and they discovered that birds have <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>identical <\/strong>genetic material to some dinosaurs. So there may still be dinosaurs among us after all.<\/p>",

I swear that I&rsquo;ll spend it in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>moderation<\/strong>, and my friend will pay you back tomorrow,&rdquo; the man said. The innkeeper gave his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>consent <\/strong>and pulled out some money.<\/p><p>The traveler knew that this was a trick. The man was going to leave with the poor innkeeper&rsquo;s money and never return. He felt <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>compassion <\/strong>for the nice innkeeper and did not want him to be tricked. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>cunning <\/strong>traveler decided to teach the innkeeper a lesson.<\/p><p>The traveler walked over to the innkeeper and sat down. The innkeeper had started to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>grind <\/strong>coffee beans to make coffee. He made the coffee and handed the traveler a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>saucer <\/strong>and a cup. The two started talking. After a while the traveler yawned and then <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>growled <\/strong>like a wolf.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Are you not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>sane<\/strong>?

Every time I yawn three times in a row, I turn into a wolf and attack people.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The innkeeper became <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>tense<\/strong>. Then the traveler yawned again. As the traveler started to yawn a third time, the innkeeper turned to run outside. As he ran, the traveler <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>snatched <\/strong>his coat. The scared innkeeper <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>staggered <\/strong>outside and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tumbled <\/strong>into the street.<\/p><p>The traveler followed him out because he did not want to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>withhold <\/strong>the truth any longer. He just wanted to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>foster <\/strong>happiness and restore the innkeeper&rsquo;s emotional <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>equilibrium<\/strong>.

She wanted to go to the beach, but her husband was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>zoology <\/strong>professor and wanted to look for some interesting animals. So now she was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>traversing <\/strong>a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>swamp <\/strong>in the midday heat.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Let me sit down, Gilbert. I&rsquo;m not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>hardy <\/strong>like you,&rdquo; she said, eventually.<\/p><p>They sat under a tree. There were lots of birds in that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>secluded<\/strong>, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>rural <\/strong>place, and they watched them flying <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>overhead<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Then suddenly Gilbert saw something on a rock. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said Gilbert. &ldquo;That looks like a Red Swamp Lizard, but I thought that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>species<\/strong> was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>extinct<\/strong>.&rdquo; He carefully picked it up. &ldquo;Yes, it is! I&rsquo;m going to take it back to the Zoology <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>Institute<\/strong>. They will be filled with so much <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>jealousy<\/strong> when they see what I have found!&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure we should take it from its home?&rdquo; asked Eliza.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense, many animals <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>migrate<\/strong>. They&rsquo;re used to changes,&rdquo; said Gilbert.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Hmm, I don&rsquo;t agree with the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>principle <\/strong>of it,&rdquo; said Eliza. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>ethical<\/strong>.&rdquo; But Gilbert was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>decisive <\/strong>and took the lizard back to the hotel in the city. He thought that this find would make him a highly <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>esteemed<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>celebrity <\/strong>at the Zoology Institute.<\/p><p>For the next few days, Gilbert fed and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>nurtured <\/strong>the lizard. But the lizard wasn&rsquo;t happy. It lost its beautiful red color and began to look ordinary. In fact, Gilbert started to wonder whether it was special at all. He went outside and found a common lizard on a piece of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>concrete<\/strong>. When he compared them, they looked exactly alike. The lizard was only red in the swamp!<\/p><p>Gilbert said to Eliza, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to return this lizard to the swamp. I&rsquo;ve learned an important lesson. Home is where we are happiest. At home, we are special like the red lizard. We can never be so happy when we are away.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Eliza. &ldquo;So, can we go home now?&rdquo;<\/p>",

It was uncomfortable, and they were hungry without any source of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>nutrition<\/strong>. Plus, the forest was filled with dangerous <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>beasts<\/strong>. Finally, Mary agreed to return to the forest people.<\/p><p>When Wilbur and Mary arrived at the village, the forest people immediately welcomed them. They gave them bread made from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>barely <\/strong>to eat and a place to sleep. The next day, the forest people led Wilbur and Mary through the trees, and they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>promptly <\/strong>arrived at a small town. From there, they took a bus to the city where they found an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>embassy<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Mary was sorry that she had not trusted the forest people sooner.

But the forests&rsquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>exotic <\/strong>trees and animals are being killed to make room for farmers and roads. People have been trying to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>conserve <\/strong>rainforests for years. But another type of forest&mdash;the cloud forest&mdash;is just as <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>beneficial <\/strong>to humans. Cloud forests are also in danger of disappearing, but little is being done to save them.<\/p><p>These forests are located at the tops of mountains, generally near the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>equator<\/strong>. These humid, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wooded <\/strong>mountaintops are mainly in African and Central and South American countries. They are called &ldquo;cloud forests&rdquo; because their height allows for the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>formation <\/strong>of clouds among the trees.<\/p><p>Rainforests produce large amounts of oxygen. Cloud forests produce <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>comparative <\/strong>amounts of water. The trees in these forests pull water out of the clouds. The moisture gathers on the leaves. When it drips, it is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>deposited <\/strong>into streams. The streams flow into towns at the bottom of the mountain. Then, it&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>distributed <\/strong>to people. The yearly <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>cumulative <\/strong>rainfall in these areas is 173-198 centimeters. Cloud forests can pull in up to 60 percent of that. This water is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>crucial <\/strong>to the plants and the people in the area. It helps them survive.<\/p><p>Cloud forests are also the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>birthplace <\/strong>of countless species of plants that can&rsquo;t be found anywhere else. One small cloud forest has the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>capacity <\/strong>for as many types of plants as there are in all of Europe. There are so many, in fact, that scientists haven&rsquo;t made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>comprehensive <\/strong>list of them yet.<\/p><p>These forests are being destroyed with increasing <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>frequency<\/strong>. Trees are being cut down, and roads are being built in their place. Some people have an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>objective <\/strong>to get <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>federal <\/strong>money to protect the forests. But they have had little success. Another <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>strategy <\/strong>is to replace the destroyed plants. That, too, has been difficult because the plants are so unique. There&rsquo;s plenty of work to be done, but saving the cloud forests is still a possibility.<\/p>",

But Thucydides didn&rsquo;t just write about history, he lived through it. However, he almost didn&rsquo;t survive one historical event: the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>Plague <\/strong>of Athens.<\/p><p>In 430 BCE, an army attacked the city of Athens, where Thucydides lived. Thousands of people hid from the army behind Athens&rsquo; large walls. The city became very crowded as the population <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>expanded<\/strong>. Then a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>horrifying <\/strong>disease broke out. People <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>summoned <\/strong>doctors. But it was to no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>avail<\/strong> because no one understood how the disease spread. It seemed <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>random<\/strong>. They didn&rsquo;t know that it was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>organism<\/strong>. Instead, they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>defined <\/strong>disease as a punishment from their gods. Thucydides was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>incredulous <\/strong>that gods caused the plague, but he explained why others believed it. There was an old, long verse which predicted the disease. To <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>paraphrase <\/strong>it, the verse said the gods would send a disease during a war. As a result, large crowds gathered at <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>shrines <\/strong>to ask the gods to stop the plague. But the situation only <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>worsened <\/strong>because these people were so close to each other they became sick. That&rsquo;s how they learned a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>fundamental <\/strong>lesson about the plague: it spread from person to person.<\/p><p>People wanted to leave the crowded city, but they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>dreaded <\/strong>what the army outside would do to them. At this time, Thucydides got sick, too. He quickly <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>scribbled <\/strong>down notes because he thought he would soon die. His writing shows a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>stark <\/strong>contrast between people&rsquo;s behavior before and during the plague. There were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>riots<\/strong>, and people ignored laws. They didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d live long enough to be punished. Many sick people were left to die in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>solitude <\/strong>because no one wanted to be near them. The plague <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>lingered <\/strong>for two years. But luckily, Thucydides survived. Without his writing, we would know much less about ancient Greece and the Plague of Athens.<\/p>",

                    "story": "<p>We live in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>mobile <\/strong>society. But the cars we drive require too much gas, plus they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>pollute <\/strong>the air. Eventually, the natural resources used to make gas will run out. So what happens then? Many people think <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>solar<\/strong>-powered <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>automobiles <\/strong>are the answer. To learn more about this type of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>transportation<\/strong>, teams from universities and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>corporate <\/strong>organizations gather in Australia every two years for a solar car race.<\/p><p>The race is called the World Solar Challenge. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>Candidates <\/strong>for this <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tournament <\/strong>must design their own cars. The teams keep all their plans confidential. They don&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>interact <\/strong>with other teams because the race is very competitive. And these cars aren&rsquo;t just <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>enhanced <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>modified<\/strong> versions of normal cars. They are completely different.<\/p><p>The cars only have room for one person and are very simple inside&mdash;they don&rsquo;t even have a cushion for the driver to sit on. These cars are shorter and much more flat than normal cars. Most importantly, the cars <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>incorporate <\/strong>solar panels onto the outside that lie <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>parallel <\/strong>to each other. These panels are made from materials that take in light from the sun and turn it into electric energy. That&rsquo;s how they move.<\/p><p>These cars race over 3,000 kilometers across the Australian <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>territories<\/strong>. The drivers have to heed strict <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>guidelines<\/strong>. They must stop at certain <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>intervals <\/strong>to charge their batteries. And unlike normal race cars, they can&rsquo;t go very fast. They have to drive at the normal speed limits. Although the drivers want to finish the race quickly, that is not the main goal. The objective is to see how well the cars work under normal driving conditions.<\/p><p>Because of the World Solar Challenge, a new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>era <\/strong>in car making and in driving is beginning. People may <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>ridicule <\/strong>the solar cars because they look strange, but this is a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>phenomenon <\/strong>that isn&rsquo;t going away. Using the technology from the vehicles, car makers will eventually create solar cars for the rest of us.<\/p>",

They couldn&rsquo;t succeed in business, and they never agreed about anything. Martin was a hardworking farmer, growing <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>organic <\/strong>vegetables and raising <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>poultry<\/strong>. But he was disorganized and forgot to pay his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>bills<\/strong>. Paul owned a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>textile <\/strong>factory that produced clothes. He was organized, but he was greedy and took too much clothing. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wardrobe <\/strong>was filled with his own products. Tom was once a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>sergeant <\/strong>in the army. He ran a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>martial <\/strong>arts school, but his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>stance <\/strong>on discipline was too strong. He had almost no students.<\/p><p>One day, they received a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>telegraph <\/strong>saying that their father had died. They were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>heirs <\/strong>to his old farm. They planned to sell it as soon as possible, so they went to see it even though there was a terrible storm. The house didn&rsquo;t look great, but there was a lot of land. There was so much, in fact, that they could barely see its <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>boundary<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Suddenly, the storm got worse. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>sheer <\/strong>force of the wind almost knocked them over. Martin said, &ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>typhoon<\/strong>!&rdquo; Paul said, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>cyclone<\/strong>.&rdquo; Tom said, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>tornado<\/strong>!&rdquo; They argued until Paul began to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>wail <\/strong>and said, &ldquo;Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s coming right at us! We&rsquo;re <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>doomed<\/strong>!&rdquo; The three brothers <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>scrambled <\/strong>inside the old house. Martin said, &ldquo;If we survive, we must stop fighting. This farm could be great if we fixed it up. With my hard work, Paul&rsquo;s organization and Tom&rsquo;s discipline, we could run a great business together!&rdquo; The storm finally ended. And luckily, it didn&rsquo;t wreck the farm.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Just think,&rdquo; Martin said, &ldquo;it took the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>chaos <\/strong>of a typhoon to bring us together.&rdquo; Paul replied, &ldquo;You mean a cyclone brought us together.&rdquo; Tom said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you both that it was a tornado?&rdquo; The brothers never agreed on what kind of storm it was, but by combining their skills, they started a successful farm.<\/p>",

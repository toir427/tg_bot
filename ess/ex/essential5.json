She knew that winter was coming and that there would soon be a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dearth <\/strong>of food. So she decided to make gathering food for winter her primary job. Gathering food was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>grueling <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>mundane <\/strong>activity, but Beth made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>deliberate <\/strong>effort because she knew that it was important. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>allotted <\/strong>herself a few hours every day to collect beans. By winter, she had collected a massive pile and hid them in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>cache<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Beth had a sister named Mary. Mary lacked ambition. She had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>fanciful <\/strong>ideas about how she would survive winter. She thought that food would just come to her and that she could work at her own <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>convenience<\/strong>. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>opted <\/strong>to spend the days playing and dancing, instead of gathering beans. When the final hours of autumn <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>elapsed<\/strong>, Mary had only a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>paltry <\/strong>amount of food stored away.<\/p><p>Mary realized that her food supply was too small to last through winter. She visited her sister. Mary said, &ldquo;Beth, lamina <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>dire <\/strong>situation. I didn&rsquo;t gather enough food for winter. Will you let me share your beans? Please have some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>empathy <\/strong>for your sister!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Beth thought for a moment. Then she replied, &ldquo;Mary, I am truly sorry for you. But I will not give you any of my beans. Instead, I will let you have my empty bag. You can still work hard and gather enough food for the winter. It will be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tedious<\/strong>, but you will learn the value of hard work.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Beth&rsquo;s words <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>appalled <\/strong>Mary. Mary cried with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>outrage<\/strong>, &ldquo;There is too much work! I won&rsquo;t have any time to dance or play!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Beth said, &ldquo;It is crucial that you gather enough food. You must have <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>sustenance <\/strong>before you have fun. Go now, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>rectify <\/strong>your situation.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Mary <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>griped <\/strong>some more, but she knew that her sister was right. She took the bag and went to work gathering her own beans for the winter.<\/p>",

Then there was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>ample <\/strong>food. The monks fed them and let them sleep in the small <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>cathedral<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Soon, however, more families were arriving every day.

They began to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>speculate <\/strong>that there would be no food. &ldquo;If more families come, we won&rsquo;t make it through the winter,&rdquo; said a young monk. &ldquo;We must ask some of them to leave.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The abbot heard this. &ldquo;We cannot do that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It would be wrong to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>deprive <\/strong>them of food and shelter.

We will <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>fast<\/strong>,&rdquo; the abbot replied. &ldquo;Also, we will give our rooms in the abbey to those sleeping outside, and we will sleep in the churchyard that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>adjoins <\/strong>the cathedral.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The monks were reluctant at first, but they did what the oldest monk said.

I even understand the great <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>theoretical <\/strong>teachings of science, such as relativity. There is nothing that I don&rsquo;t know. Whether it&rsquo;s the movements of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>celestial <\/strong>objects, like planets and stars, or how to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>harness <\/strong>the power of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>radioactive <\/strong>substances, I know everything.&rdquo;<\/p><p>But actually, there was something the bachelor did not know. Though his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>analytic <\/strong>abilities were great, he failed to notice he was missing something very important in his life.<\/p><p>One day while walking through town, the bachelor witnessed a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>collision <\/strong>between two cars. Both drivers appeared to be injured, but the scholar only stood and watched.<\/p><p>He thought to himself, &ldquo;Those idiots should have been more alert. They really must not be very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>competent<\/strong>.&rdquo; He never thought the drivers needed help.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Please help me,&rdquo; said the female driver in a weak voice. &ldquo;Help me, too,&rdquo; said the male driver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hurt and can&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Suddenly the bachelor realized he was the only person near the accident. He quit thinking and ran to help the drivers. He carefully helped them out of their vehicles and then called an ambulance.<\/p><p>The drivers were saved, and the bachelor felt the best he had in his entire life. Studying <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>mythology<\/strong>, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>sociology<\/strong>, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>geology <\/strong>didn&rsquo;t give him this wonderful feeling. It was the act of helping others, not his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>cognitive <\/strong>skills, that gave him this great feeling.<\/p><p>He had learned an important lesson. He learned that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>intellect <\/strong>isn&rsquo;t everything; being helpful is just as important. &ldquo;Having only a brain is not enough,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;You must also have a heart.&rdquo;<\/p>",

It was a great <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>incentive<\/strong>. Pig had always wanted to be as <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>affluent <\/strong>as his bosses.<\/p><p>Mr. Pig returned to the factory and started making changes. However, most were not very nice, and some were not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>legitimate<\/strong>.<\/p><p>First, he fired all his employees. Then he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>automated <\/strong>the entire factory. Machines now made everything, and the other animals, Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Sheep, and Mr. Dog had no jobs. Next, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>bribed <\/strong>some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>corrupt <\/strong>senators into <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>legislating <\/strong>special <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>subsidies <\/strong>for the factory. Finally, instead of paying a company to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>dispose <\/strong>of the factory&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>rubbish <\/strong>properly, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>violated <\/strong>the law by throwing it into the river to save money.<\/p><p>At first, all the changes to the factory&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>infrastructure <\/strong>created more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>revenue<\/strong>. But soon many stores could no longer sell the factory&rsquo;s goods at <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>retail<\/strong>. It seemed that the machines couldn&rsquo;t make products as well as the workers. The customers were disappointed with the factory&rsquo;s merchandise.<\/p><p>There were other problems, too. The animals had told their friends and family to stop buying the factory&rsquo;s goods. Officials discovered the factory&rsquo;s rubbish in the river, and when they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>audited <\/strong>the company, they discovered that Pig had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>manipulated <\/strong>the law in order to get more money.<\/p><p>All <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>transactions <\/strong>with Pig&rsquo;s factory stopped. The factory lost money, and Pig lost his job. He realized his mistakes too late. He had tried to become rich by saving money any way possible, but the cheapest way was not always the best.<\/p>",

In his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>haste <\/strong>to go on vacation, Alexander Fleming had left his laboratory in a mess. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>essence <\/strong>of his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>ongoing <\/strong>work involved a type of bacteria. An infection caused by the bacteria was often <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>terminal<\/strong>, and he was looking for a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>remedy<\/strong>. He had left the bacteria out while he was away.<\/p><p>When he returned from vacation, he found that his lab was covered in fungus. He started cleaning up the mess. While he was cleaning, he had an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>impulse <\/strong>to examine the fungus. He saw that whenever the fungus was in close <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>proximity <\/strong>to the bacteria, the bacteria died.<\/p><p>Though he was a messy scientist, his experiments were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>precise<\/strong>. He thought that there might be some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>significance <\/strong>to the fungus. He immediately <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>commenced <\/strong>an experiment to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>assess <\/strong>what had happened to the bacteria. It had either died by accident or the fungus had killed it. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>subsequent <\/strong>tests proved it was the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>latter <\/strong>reason.<\/p><p>What he found <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>astonished <\/strong>him. The fungus actually killed the bad bacteria. All this time, he had been looking for a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>synthetic <\/strong>material to kill the bacteria. Instead, a common fungus did the job.<\/p><p>He knew that something in the fungus had killed the bacteria. His next step was to find those <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>molecules <\/strong>that had done it. When he found them, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>extracted <\/strong>them and put them into a pill. The drug proved to be very effective. It also worked against other types of harmful bacteria.<\/p><p>The discovery received a lot of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>publicity<\/strong>. Soon after, the new drug was being used all over the world. Because of the success, the scientist was able to develop even more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>fabulous <\/strong>drugs to help people. His accidental discovery changed the world and helped save many people&rsquo;s lives.<\/p>",

He washed ashore on a small island, but he had gotten hurt during the storm. He had a terrible <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>migraine<\/strong>, and he had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>fracture <\/strong>in his shoulder. He felt awful. But he had a strong desire to make it home to his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>spouse <\/strong>and children. He had to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tolerate <\/strong>all the pain and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>devise <\/strong>a plan.<\/p><p>Bob stood up and looked around. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk to a higher <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>altitude<\/strong>, so I can see everything around me,&rdquo; thought Bob. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll gain some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>insight<\/strong> about this island and find something to help me escape.&rdquo; As he walked along a mountain <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>ridge<\/strong>, he noticed that the tall <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>indigenous <\/strong>trees looked sturdy and thick. Bob got a brilliant idea. He could build a raft! He cut down some leaves and tree <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>limbs<\/strong>. Even though his shoulder injury <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>impaired<\/strong> his ability to carry the materials, he slowly dragged them down the mountain until he reached the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>coastline<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Bob was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>proficient <\/strong>builder. He used his building <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>expertise <\/strong>to line up the limbs and tie them together with long vines. When the raft was finished, Bob was happy with his work. &ldquo;This will bring me home to my family,&rdquo; he said with a smile.<\/p><p>At last, Bob was ready to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>implement <\/strong>his escape plan. With all his might, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>thrust <\/strong>the raft into the water. He climbed on and began the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>quest <\/strong>to find his way home. Bob smiled again, and thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I kept a good attitude. It prevented the pain from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>deterring <\/strong>me from my plan. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>Optimism <\/strong>and ambition make anything possible.&rdquo; Slowly, he floated out to sea. In a few days, he made it to shore and ran home to see his happy family.<\/p>",

It attacked people&rsquo;s lungs, causing them to need a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>respirator <\/strong>to breathe. I was trying out a new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>medication <\/strong>to treat these people instead of using a respirator. If I was successful, I would become famous.<\/p><p>Everything was going fine until war broke out in a nearby country. Many people from that country fled the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>hostile <\/strong>invading army. The army wanted to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>dominate <\/strong>the people, but the people didn&rsquo;t want to be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>oppressed<\/strong>. So they walked hundreds of miles across <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>barren <\/strong>land to get away.<\/p><p>Some of these people came to our clinic for treatment. I talked with them and learned of their difficulties. They did not beg or complain. I was impressed by their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dignity<\/strong>.<\/p><p>There was one woman I will never forget. Her son suffered from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>malnutrition <\/strong>and stomach pain, and she didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Neither did I.I was not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>adept <\/strong>at treating malnutrition. Nonetheless, when I saw her sadness, I knew I had to help her son.<\/p><p>The woman had been feeding her son bread and water. She had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>misconception <\/strong>that it would be enough for him. However, I knew that he needed to eat vegetables, too. So I took her outside and showed her a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dense <\/strong>patch of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>edible <\/strong>plants. I taught her howto dig up the roots, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>peel<\/strong> them, and cook them for her son. I explained that she should increase her son&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>intake <\/strong>of these vegetables. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>Likewise<\/strong>, she should <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>strive <\/strong>to get him some meat once a week to help him regain his strength.<\/p><p>I sent her off with a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>prescription <\/strong>for some pain medicine, but she also left my office with some new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>culinary <\/strong>skills. A few weeks later, she returned to tell me her son was healthy again. As thanks, she gave me a beautiful <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>ceramic <\/strong>bowl.<\/p><p>I never become famous, but I kept that bowl to remind me what it truly means to heal someone.<\/p>",

It wove faster and straighter than anyone could weave by hand. He decided to take it to two cities on a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>peninsula<\/strong>, Netherton and Wilton. In these cities, a large <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>proportion <\/strong>of the people worked in weaving. Joseph felt sure he could sell his machine there.<\/p><p>Joseph first took his machine to the mayor of Netherton. &ldquo;Think of the money you will earn from this machine!&rdquo; Joseph said to him.<\/p><p>But the mayor was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>benevolent <\/strong>man. He knew about the people&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dependence <\/strong>on weaving for their livelihood. If he bought the machine, the people would lose their jobs. So he refused to buy it.<\/p><p>Joseph said, &ldquo;We are no longer in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>medieval <\/strong>age! Soon everything will be made by machines. Cloth made by hand will soon be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>obsolete<\/strong>. If you don&rsquo;t change your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>archaic <\/strong>ways, your town&rsquo;s income will <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>diminish<\/strong>!&rdquo;<\/p><p>But the mayor said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>capitalism<\/strong>. Don&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>impose <\/strong>your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>radical <\/strong>ideas on my town. Go away!&rdquo;<\/p><p>So Joseph took his machine to the mayor at Wilton. This mayorthought Joseph&rsquo;s machine was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>spectacular <\/strong>and spent a long time looking at its different <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>components <\/strong>made of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>brass<\/strong>. The mayor couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>refute <\/strong>the fact that the machine had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>drawbacks <\/strong>that would affect the people&rsquo;s jobs. But he realized the machine could bring money and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>prestige<\/strong>. So he ordered Joseph to build twenty of them.<\/p><p>Within a year, Wilton was a wealthy city, famous for its wonderful cloth. People no longer wove but worked in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>managerial <\/strong>jobs at cloth factories instead. Nobody bought the cloth from Netherton anymore. The people of Netherton became poor and hungry.<\/p><p>Finally, the mayor of Netherton called Joseph and said, &ldquo;Now I realize that your machine is not just a passing <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>fad<\/strong>. To succeed in business, we must be willing to change.&rdquo; He then ordered twenty weaving machines.<\/p><p>After that, both Netherton and Wilton became rich cities, famous throughout the land for their wonderful cloth.<\/p>",

He was unhappy all the time. Bill knew that he had to do something about it, or he would be depressed for the rest of his life.<\/p><p>One day, Bill was in his office when he heard a knock at the door. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; Bill said loudly.<\/p><p>His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accountant<\/strong>, Jane, walked in.

I have <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>contempt <\/strong>toward my job. I just want to do something I enjoy. I&rsquo;ve always loved growing plants as a hobby.

I&rsquo;m tired of all this stress. Farming will make me happy.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The very next day, Bill carried out the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>preliminary <\/strong>task of buying land and tools. Then he got to work. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>sowed <\/strong>many types of seeds. He planted soy, cabbage, carrots, and onions.<\/p><p>&ldquo;The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>upcoming <\/strong>summer is going to be very dry,&rdquo; thought Bill. &ldquo;I need to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>irrigate <\/strong>my crops as a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>precaution<\/strong>, in case it doesn&rsquo;t rain enough.&rdquo; He took his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>spade <\/strong>and dug a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>ditch <\/strong>down the middle of his farm. &ldquo;Water from the stream will flow down the ditch and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>saturate <\/strong>the soil around every plant,&rdquo; Bill thought.<\/p><p>Bill <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>dedicated <\/strong>himself to farming.

Many <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>biographies <\/strong>have been written that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>narrate <\/strong>his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>dominance <\/strong>in the music world. But do you know what really makes him special? Even though millions of people got to hear his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>multiple<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>masterpieces<\/strong>, he never did. Beethoven wrote his best pieces after he went completely deaf!<\/p><p>His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>partiality <\/strong>toward classical music developed when he was very young. He wasn&rsquo;t interested in anything else as a child. When he was five, he learned how to play the piano. From then, nothing could stop his passion for writing and playing music.<\/p><p>When Beethoven was twenty, he began to lose his hearing. He got <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acute<\/strong>, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>spontaneous <\/strong>pains in his ears. His hearing kept getting worse over time. It was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>inevitable <\/strong>that he would eventually lose it altogether. It was very hard for him to keep writing music. He lost the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>virtue <\/strong>of patience, and he became <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>notorious <\/strong>for his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>aggression<\/strong>. Still, he never stopped trying. His passion for music <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>compelled <\/strong>him to keep performing even after he went deaf. He couldn&rsquo;t hear himself play, but he knew that his creations sounded <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>gorgeous<\/strong>.<\/p><p>His final concert was held at a huge <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>banquet<\/strong>. He gave the musicians a cue, and they began to play. He directed the concert with all his heart. He couldn&rsquo;t hear the music, but he said that he could feel it. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>Overall<\/strong>, performance was one of the finest in history. When it was over, he turned to the crowd. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>clapped <\/strong>and cheered wildly. In that beautiful moment, the applause <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>boosted <\/strong>his emotions, and he began to cry.<\/p><p>In 1827, he suffered from lead poisoning. He didn&rsquo;t survive the sickness, but his music did because great music never becomes <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>outdated<\/strong>. Even though Beethoven is gone, his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>legacy <\/strong>will live on forever.<\/p>",

He had a mustache and was very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>muscular<\/strong>. He was a sculptor. He made things out of stone. Mark was a good artist, but he was not very intelligent.<\/p><p>John looked nothing like his brother. He was small and weak, but he was very smart. John was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>undergraduate <\/strong>in college, and he studied <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>anthropology <\/strong>and history. He knew a lot about ancient cultures. The brothers loved each other very much, but they thought they had nothing in common.<\/p><p>One day, the mayor <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>appointed <\/strong>Mark to build a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>monument<\/strong>: a statue of Egyptian Pharaoh, Tut. Mark agreed to do the job, but he had a problem. He had no idea who Pharaoh Tut was! However, he thought he had the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>competence <\/strong>to build a good statue anyway. He made some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>crude <\/strong>measurements and sculpted a statue of a very old man with a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tattoo <\/strong>on his chest. Mark was proud of his work, but when John saw the statue, he laughed aloud.<\/p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo; Mark asked.<\/p><p>John replied, &ldquo;Your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>ignorance <\/strong>makes me laugh. Don&rsquo;t you know that Tut was only a teenager when he was pharaoh? Let me help you. I&rsquo;ll <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>supervise <\/strong>your work. I&rsquo;ll give you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>feedback<\/strong>, and we&rsquo;ll make this a great monument.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Mark got another <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>cube <\/strong>of stone. John told him what Tut looked like. &ldquo;Make him tall with good <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>posture<\/strong>,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;And make sure there is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>symmetry <\/strong>in his body.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Mark <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>conferred <\/strong>with John about every detail. For ten <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>consecutive <\/strong>hours, the brothers worked. At last, the finished statue was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>situated <\/strong>in front of the museum. Everyone <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>applauded <\/strong>the brothers&rsquo; good work.<\/p><p>&ldquo;We worked together very well. I guess we are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>compatible <\/strong>after all,&rdquo; Mark said.<\/p><p>John replied, &ldquo;I agree! When we combine our talents, we are capable of greatness.&rdquo;<\/p>",

The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>premise <\/strong>of this experiment is that it will help you understand what it&rsquo;s like to be blind,&rdquo; she said.<\/p><p>Sam was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>skeptic<\/strong>. He really didn&rsquo;t think the assignment would be too challenging. On Saturday morning, Sam took a piece of cloth and tied it around his head to cover his eyes. Then he went into the kitchen for breakfast. He heard the voices of his parents and brothers but couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>specify <\/strong>where each voice was coming from. He thought about how important hearing is for blind people.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Could you pass me the newspaper, please?&rdquo; he asked. Just then, he remembered he couldn&rsquo;t see the words on the page. He wondered if <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>Braille <\/strong>newspapers were ever made.<\/p><p>After finishing breakfast, his brothers asked him to play soccer. As he followed them, he accidentally walked into the baker&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>rack<\/strong>. He also found that he couldn&rsquo;t play soccer. He wouldn&rsquo;t be able to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>coordinate <\/strong>his actions without being able to see. Without his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>optic <\/strong>senses, he had no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>spatial <\/strong>awareness. Furthermore, he couldn&rsquo;t do <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>simultaneous <\/strong>activities because he had to make sure he was safe first.<\/p><p>He sat on the lawn. Suddenly, he realized that though he couldn&rsquo;t see, his other senses worked perfectly fine. In fact, he began to realize new and different <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>aspects <\/strong>of common objects. For example, he took a flower <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>bud <\/strong>and felt it with his finger. He realized for the first time that it seemed to be covered with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wax<\/strong>.<\/p><p>His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>hypothesis <\/strong>about being blind was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>disproved<\/strong>. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>informative <\/strong>experiment had an imprint on him. It showed him sight was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>asset <\/strong>that should be appreciated and taught him to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>revere <\/strong>the talents of blind people.<\/p>",

Usually, he used them for his firm, which <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>imported<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>marble <\/strong>statues from other countries. But today he was going fishing. And the ship he chose was his favorite. It had an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>elaborate <\/strong>painting on the side that showed a naval battle. It also had some new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>updates <\/strong>to its computer system. His favorite ship&rsquo;s latest <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>acquisition <\/strong>was a device with a small <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>grid <\/strong>to show the ship&rsquo;s exact location. This new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accessory <\/strong>kept Ernest from getting lost.<\/p><p>At daybreak, Ernest happily sailed the temperate waters until he was far from land. Then he saw a small boat in the distance. There was an old man standing next to its <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>mast<\/strong>. He was waving his arms in the air. There was also a boy with his head hanging over the boat&rsquo;s edge. Ernest <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>inferred <\/strong>that the boy was suffering from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>nausea<\/strong>. Both of their clothes were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>saturated <\/strong>with sea water. Ernest assumed that they were in trouble. Most people never realized, but Ernest had an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>innate <\/strong>desire to help people. He began sailing toward them, eager to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>facilitate <\/strong>their rescue and thus solve their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dilemma<\/strong>.<\/p><p>As he got closer to the boat, he was shocked by its simplicity. The boat&rsquo;s wood looked no stronger than <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>cardboard<\/strong>, and the equipment was old. Still, there were several large fish in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>pouch <\/strong>in the boat.<\/p><p>Ernest threw a large package onto the boat. He yelled, &ldquo;Here! You can <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>inflate <\/strong>this boat to get you back to land.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo; screamed the old man.<\/p><p>Ernest was confused. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you need help?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Your ship doesn&rsquo;t seem <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>adequate <\/strong>enough to sail so far away from land.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just scared away a huge fish,&rdquo; the boy said. &ldquo;We waved to let you know you were too close to us.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Ernest turned around and headed home. He learned that it&rsquo;s better not to help unless asked to. Otherwise, you might not help anyone at all.<\/p>",

In fact, a Leonardo Da Vinci&rsquo;s drawing <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>corresponds <\/strong>closely with the modern parachute design!<\/p><p>In 1783, French scientist Sebastian Lenormand invented the first modern parachute. Sebastian <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>brainstormed <\/strong>with other scientists to come up with a way to help people jump safely out of burning buildings. He thought the solution was to give people an object to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>restrict <\/strong>their speed while they traveled toward the ground. Many people thought that he was up to some kind of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>fraud<\/strong>, but Sebastian had a lot of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>integrity<\/strong>. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>budget <\/strong>was limited, so he first tested his theory by using two umbrellas. He jumped out of a tree and found that the umbrellas worked.<\/p><p>Next, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>refined <\/strong>his invention. Rather than using umbrellas, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>knit <\/strong>a large parachute. Finally, he jumped off a tall building on a French <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>estate <\/strong>and landed safely in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>courtyard<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Sebastian&rsquo;s work gave another man an idea. Jean-Pierre Blanchard had a different <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>outlook <\/strong>than Sebastian. He was a hot air balloon <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>addict<\/strong>. He was one of the first people to ride in a hot air balloon powered by <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>hydrogen <\/strong>gas. He was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>proponent <\/strong>of using the parachutes to exit from hot air balloons. Starting in 1785, he used his dog to show that animals could land safely from hot air balloons by using parachutes. Then, in 1793, he was faced with a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>chaotic <\/strong>experience. The hot air balloon he was riding in burst and started to fall. He was forced to use a parachute himself. And much to his relief, it saved his life!<\/p>",

The day before, a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>donor <\/strong>gave the school a painting with a sports <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>theme<\/strong>. It showed a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>referee <\/strong>congratulating two athletes. The principal hung the painting in front of the office, hoping that it would be a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>stimulus <\/strong>for students to play sports. The next morning, however, the painting was destroyed. There was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>graffiti <\/strong>on it, and it had many holes in it. The worst part was that one of Billy&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>fellow <\/strong>students said she thought she saw Billy do it!<\/p><p>But Billy didn&rsquo;t do it. The principal called Billy&rsquo;s parents and said, &ldquo;Billy won&rsquo;t tell us the truth. He&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>chronic <\/strong>liar, and he ruined the painting. If you don&rsquo;t pay for it, we&rsquo;ll <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>terminate <\/strong>his education here.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Billy&rsquo;s parents didn&rsquo;t have enough money to pay for the painting and for his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tuition<\/strong>. But Billy&rsquo;s parents had an idea. That afternoon, they went to see Mr. Meyers, an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>attorney<\/strong>.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Meyers, my son has been <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>implicated <\/strong>in a crime he says he didn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; Billy&rsquo;s father said. &ldquo;Everybody believes the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>gossip<\/strong>. Even some of our own <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>kin <\/strong>think he did it!&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;I believe you. My <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>suspicion <\/strong>is that the tape from the security cameras will show who really did it,&rdquo; said Mr. Meyers.<\/p><p>The next day, Mr. Meyers received a packet with the videotape from the school. It showed another student who resembled Billy walking up to the painting and writing on it. Then the student took a knife by the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>shaft <\/strong>and started to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>stab <\/strong>large holes in it. Finally, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>severed <\/strong>the rope that held up the painting, and it fell to the floor.<\/p><p>Mr. Meyers showed the tape to the principal. &ldquo;Clearly, that&rsquo;s not Billy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This boy is actually responsible and needs some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>discipline<\/strong>.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Billy was happy that someone believed him. He said to Mr. Meyers, &ldquo;When I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>graduate <\/strong>and go to university, I will major in law, so I can be a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>guardian <\/strong>of justice like you!&rdquo;<\/p>",

He knew he may never be set free, but it was a decision that he was willing to accept.<\/p><p>In the morning, he was led from the prisoners&rsquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>compound <\/strong>to one of the king&rsquo;s arenas. A gate coated in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>rust <\/strong>stood between him and the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>auditorium<\/strong>&rsquo;s floor. He was worried, but he knew what he had to do.<\/p><p>When the gate opened, he calmly walked to the center of the arena and sat. He started to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>meditate<\/strong>. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>foe <\/strong>Darius, who was skilled in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>realm<\/strong> of sword fighting and was typically not very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>aggressive<\/strong>, would not fight the quiet soldier until he attacked Darius first.<\/p><p>Darius tried to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>provoke <\/strong>him by <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>hacking <\/strong>at the air close to his head with his sword. But the soldier was not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>distracted<\/strong>. He sat quietly, as if he were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>dumb<\/strong>, and looked calmly up at the sky. Even when Darius <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>nicked <\/strong>him on the cheek with the edge of his sword, the soldier did not move.<\/p><p>At last he threw down his sword and shield and gave up. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fight someone who refuses to fight me!&rdquo; Darius shouted to the king.<\/p><p>The king was very impressed with the soldier. Never in any battle had he seen someone so brave. As a result, he gave the peaceful soldier <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>amnesty<\/strong>. The soldier&rsquo;s actions proved to the king and everyone in the arena that peace was more powerful than fighting.<\/p>",

They called it &ldquo;High Hopes.&rdquo; The two loved to spend time together on the ocean and would often go on long fishing trips.<\/p><p>Mike taught Jane how to perform important tasks. Jane learned how to steer the boat and adjust the sails. She learned how to put <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>grease <\/strong>on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>intricate <\/strong>gears of the motor. She learned how to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>submerge <\/strong>the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>anchor <\/strong>and secure it by putting a rope in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>slot<\/strong>. Jane liked helping her father, but she thought that she wasn&rsquo;t very good at it. Sometimes, she omitted important steps and made <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>frequent <\/strong>mistakes. Jane thought she wasn&rsquo;t capable of manual labor.<\/p><p>Mike wanted to prove to her that she was indeed capable and important. He thought of a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tactic <\/strong>to test Jane&rsquo;s skills in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>context <\/strong>of a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>catastrophe<\/strong>. He hid under the deck and pretended to be trapped. He shouted, &ldquo;Jane, I can&rsquo;t get out! You have to get back to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>dock <\/strong>and find help!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Jane began to panic. She thought she might make her usual mistakes, which would <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>precipitate <\/strong>a disaster. However, she had to listen to her dad and act <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accordingly<\/strong>. She pulled up the anchor with all of her might. She remembered to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>overlap <\/strong>the sails to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>offset <\/strong>the wind. She steered the boat around <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>buoys <\/strong>where the water was shallow. When they got to shore, Mike came out from under the deck.<\/p><p>Jane said, &ldquo;I thought you were trapped!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Mike laughed. He said, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>genuine <\/strong>emergency. I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>distorted <\/strong>the truth to test your abilities. Look at what a great job you did getting the boat home safely! I knew you could do it.&rdquo;<\/p><p>To honor his daughter, Mike decided to rename his boat. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>designated <\/strong>it &ldquo;Jane&rsquo;s Pride&rdquo; and painted the name on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>fore <\/strong>of the ship. Jane finally had something to be proud of.<\/p>",

They are made up of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>compressed <\/strong>electrical <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>circuits <\/strong>that can detect and record data about the body. They are tiny, but they hold the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>equivalent <\/strong>amount of data as most computers.<\/p><p>A microchip is put to use inside a person with a simple procedure. First, a doctor must put data about the patient onto a chip. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>Input <\/strong>about the person&rsquo;s age, race, gender, and medical history is stored on the chip. The second <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>phase <\/strong>of the process involves putting it in the person&rsquo;s skin. The doctor <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>pinches <\/strong>a piece of skin and cuts a tiny hole with a tool shaped like a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>spiral<\/strong>. The chip is inserted, and the skin is allowed to heal. At last, it begins the task of putting data into its <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>database<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Microchips scan the patient&rsquo;s body to record what is happening on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>quantum <\/strong>level. They can find problems with the person&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>metabolism <\/strong>and organs. They can also detect <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>viral <\/strong>infections. They can find the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>aggregate <\/strong>number of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>immune <\/strong>and infected cells and present the results in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>ratio<\/strong>. They can even tell doctors what type of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>antibiotic <\/strong>to give to the patient!<\/p><p>To recover the chip&rsquo;s data, the doctor uses a special <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>magnet <\/strong>that copies it. This way, the doctor can put the information from the chip onto a computer. Then they can find out exactly what is wrong with the person.<\/p><p>The idea of putting chips in humans is still very new. However, it is now becoming more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>prevalent<\/strong>. Scientists and doctors are hopeful about the future uses of microchips. Someday, all new babies might get a microchip soon after they are born. Doctors will be able to know about any problems from the very beginning. It is obvious that medicine and computers <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>complement <\/strong>each other well.<\/p>",

They were almost like <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>clones<\/strong>. They even used the same colloquial language as each other. They were best friends.<\/p><p>But the twins&rsquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>attributes <\/strong>were not all identical. Alice liked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>humanities<\/strong>, and Katie was a good <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>linguist<\/strong>. One summer, Katie decided to be a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>participant <\/strong>at a summer camp in France. Alice wasn&rsquo;t interested in the French language, so she didn&rsquo;t go. But she felt angry that Katie wanted to spend the summer away from her.<\/p><p>Two months later, Katie returned. Alice <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>dashed <\/strong>to the airport to greet her sister. But when Alice saw Katie, she was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>astounded<\/strong>. Katie was now <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bilingual<\/strong>, and she looked completely different! She was wearing nice clothes, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>cosmetics <\/strong>and looked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>skinnier<\/strong>. Alice felt very messy next to her. She was just wearing a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>fluorescent <\/strong>t-shirt, and her hair had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>knots <\/strong>in it.<\/p><p>When Alice asked Katie about France, Katie was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vague <\/strong>and didn&rsquo;t say much. It made Alice <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>furious <\/strong>and filled her with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>disgust <\/strong>because in the past they&rsquo;d always told each other everything. Now there was a huge <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>gulf <\/strong>between them. Over the weeks, the sisters spoke even less.<\/p><p>Two months later, it was the twins&rsquo; birthday. All their lives, they&rsquo;d had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>ritual<\/strong>. Before their birthday, they&rsquo;d talk all night long. That night, Alice came into Katie&rsquo;s bedroom.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I haven&rsquo;t spoken much lately,&rdquo; Katie said.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I understand. You have new friends now,&rdquo; said Alice, angrily.<\/p><p>Katie said, &ldquo;My French friends don&rsquo;t write much nowadays. For a while, I thought they were more exciting than my friends at home. But I was wrong. You&rsquo;re my sister, and you&rsquo;ll always be my best friend.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Alice said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, too. I wanted our relationship to stay the same forever. But it&rsquo;s totally <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>plausible <\/strong>for twins to have different interests. We can still be best friends without being together all the time.&rdquo;<\/p>",

Bioco <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>manufactured <\/strong>drugs to treat <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>diabetes <\/strong>and high <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>cholesterol<\/strong>. Jack&rsquo;s job was to use a tiny <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>mechanism <\/strong>to get <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>nectar <\/strong>from flowers. The nectar was a main ingredient in the drugs. Jack liked his job, and he thought that Bioco was a caring company. However, Jack soon learned that the company wasn&rsquo;t as kind as he first thought.<\/p><p>Bioco&rsquo;s motto was &ldquo;Make the Earth a Better Place.&rdquo; However, this motto was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>deceptive<\/strong>. The company actually did a number of really bad things to the environment. The company produced a lot of smog and harmful <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acid<\/strong>. Bioco poured the acid in a nearby river, which caused <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>erosion <\/strong>and made fish <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>prone <\/strong>to illness.<\/p><p>After a few weeks at the new job, Jack saw all the bad things Bioco was doing. He had always had strong <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>ethics<\/strong>, and he knew he had to do something. One day, while the Bioco workers were eating in the cafeteria, Jack stood up and gave a speech. He said, &ldquo;My fellow coworkers, I know you have all seen the evil things our company is doing. I have a notion that we can fix them if we form a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>coalition<\/strong>. We can go to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>administration <\/strong>and tell them we&rsquo;ll quit if they don&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>eliminate <\/strong>the problems. They&rsquo;ll have no choice but to listen to us.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Jack explained what they were to do. His coworkers liked his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>explicit <\/strong>plan. They went to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>administrative <\/strong>offices and demanded that Bioco stop damaging the environment, or they all would quit. One supervisor said to them, &ldquo;Thank you for being <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>straightforward <\/strong>about this issue. Since I can&rsquo;t afford to lose all of you workers, I guess we&rsquo;ll just have to fix things.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Jack, his supervisor, and his coworkers spent the next month designing a new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>framework <\/strong>for the company. They cleaned up the acid from the river and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>minimized <\/strong>the amount of air pollution the company released. At last, the company motto became apt.<\/p>",

Some of the crew were hurt, so the pilot decided to stay with them and wait for help. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>arrogant <\/strong>executive, though, didn&rsquo;t care about the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>welfare <\/strong>of the pilot and crew. Rather, he thought he could walkout of the jungle and find a town to stay in.<\/p><p>He followed a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>trail <\/strong>through a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>canyon <\/strong>and along a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>creek<\/strong>. The jungle was actually very stunning. If the arrogant executive had stopped to look around, he might have <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>perceived <\/strong>the jungle&rsquo;s beauty. But he was in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>nasty <\/strong>mood and had no care for the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>aesthetic <\/strong>value of the jungle. He continued to walk up the steep <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>incline <\/strong>of the jungle&rsquo;s hills.<\/p><p>Soon, he was lost. Several days passed, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>fatigue <\/strong>and hunger weakened him. He was very tired and afraid.<\/p><p>Just then, a monkey came out of the trees. It was carrying a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>twig <\/strong>covered in honey. It walked up to a mound where <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>termites <\/strong>lived. He then used the twig like a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>drill <\/strong>to make a hole in the mound. Then very carefully, it removed the twig from the hole. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sticky <\/strong>twig was covered with termites.<\/p><p>Instead of eating the bugs, the monkey offered them to the executive, but he didn&rsquo;t want what the monkey offered. He shouted at the monkey, &ldquo;Get away from me, you stupid <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>primate<\/strong>!&rdquo;<\/p><p>The executive&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>stereotype <\/strong>of the monkey was wrong. The monkey was not stupid. It knew how to find food, whereas the executive did not. He refused the help of the monkey, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>thereby <\/strong>leaving himself to starve.<\/p><p>When the executive was finally found, he was very skinny and sick. He had not eaten for a very longtime. Because he held a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bias <\/strong>against the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>primitive <\/strong>ways of the monkey, he had gone hungry and almost died. The executive didn&rsquo;t understand that it was his arrogant attitude that had caused all of his problems.<\/p>",

Cosmo was scared that his dreams were a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>preview <\/strong>of what was going to happen on his flight the next day.<\/p><p>Cosmo was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>supernatural <\/strong>being who was about to turn 15 years old. In his culture, boys of his age were required to participate in an important <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>rite<\/strong>. They were given wings and instructed to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>orbit <\/strong>the Earth. After successful flights, the boys officially became men. Cosmo certainly wanted to be a man, but he was scared. He went to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>oracle <\/strong>of a god named Dano. Cosmo said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I can make such a long trip. What if I get tired? What if my strength <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>stalls<\/strong>, and I can&rsquo;t stay in the air. I&rsquo;ll crash and die!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Dano replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. You have all the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>relevant <\/strong>skills in your personal <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>inventory <\/strong>that have been building up over the years. To ease your worry, let me tell you a little about what will happen tomorrow. You&rsquo;ll begin over Africa. You&rsquo;ll keep flying north until you come to the Himalayas. The mountaintops will look like small <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>loaves <\/strong>of bread at such a high distance. The rivers of the world will look like pieces of blue string that cross the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>globe<\/strong>. Keep your body <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>horizontal <\/strong>when flying against the winds of the Pacific Ocean. Keep your eyes open and enjoy the beauty of the Earth. You will be fine, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Cosmo replied, &ldquo;Thanks for the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>overview <\/strong>of my journey, I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The next morning, Cosmo was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>provided <\/strong>with a divine set of wings and sent on his way. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>flapped <\/strong>his wings and went high above the Earth. He flew over mountains, oceans, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>glaciers<\/strong>. After a while, his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>inward <\/strong>thoughts were no longer about falling. He was actually having fun! He began to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>hum <\/strong>a song as he enjoyed the view. When he reached home, his tribe was there to greet him.<\/p><p>The chief said, &ldquo;On <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>behalf <\/strong>of the tribe, I declare you a man. We&rsquo;re proud of you, Cosmo!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Cosmo was proud of himself, too.<\/p>",

The idea of taking an organ out of one person and putting it into another was just a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>fantasy<\/strong>. But the brothers decided to be brave and found a doctor who could make organ transplants a reality.<\/p><p>Since Richard and Robert were twins, their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>heredity <\/strong>was identical. They had the exact same <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>biological <\/strong>traits. Even their kidneys were identical on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>cellular <\/strong>level. Therefore, Robert&rsquo;s working kidney could be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>substituted <\/strong>for Richard&rsquo;s bad one. Richard&rsquo;s body could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>adapt <\/strong>to the new organ if the operation was done correctly.<\/p><p>The twins went to Dr. Murray, who was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>pioneer <\/strong>of new surgical methods. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>dynamic <\/strong>team of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>surgeons <\/strong>performed the transplant. Dr. Murray made sure his surgeons followed a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>rigid<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>sequence <\/strong>of directions so that no mistakes were made. First, they made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>minimal <\/strong>cut in Richard&rsquo;s side and removed the bad kidney. Then, they made another small cut in Robert&rsquo;s side, removed his kidney, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>transferred <\/strong>it into Richard&rsquo;s body. Finally, they sewed up the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>respective <\/strong>cuts. The entire operation only took about one hour.<\/p><p>After the surgery, it was clear that both brothers were going to be OK. The operation was confirmed a success. Richard&rsquo;s new kidney worked great! Doctors <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>prescribed <\/strong>medicine for the pain caused by the surgery. Since Richard was still weak, he used physical <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>therapy <\/strong>to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>revive <\/strong>his strength. At last, Richard&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>transition <\/strong>into a healthy, happy person was complete.<\/p><p>Dr. Murray became a hero in the medical world. His success gave other doctors confidence to try organ transplants themselves. Now, doctors perform life-saving transplants and surgeries every day.<\/p>",

The director interviewed dozens of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>applicants <\/strong>before he decided to hire Jen. She was chosen because she was friendly, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>punctual <\/strong>and had a great attitude.<\/p><p>On her first day, Jen got to work and prepared to give her first tour. She looked at the names on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>register<\/strong>. She saw that the Queen of England and a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>diplomat <\/strong>were visiting the museum. She thought, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my very first day, and I have to impress a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>monarch<\/strong>! I hope I don&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>humiliate <\/strong>myself in front of a person of such <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>renown<\/strong>!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Jen was nervous. She took a deep breath and said, &ldquo;Hello, everyone! I&rsquo;m going to talk to you about the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>chronology <\/strong>of ancient Egypt.&rdquo; As she turned around to show the group some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>artifacts<\/strong>, she bumped into a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>fossil <\/strong>of an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>authentic <\/strong>elephant <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tusk<\/strong>. It fell to the ground and broke into a million pieces! &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; said Jen in a subtle voice. &ldquo;I sure hope the rest of the tour goes better than this!&rdquo;<\/p><p>The rest of the tour did not go any better. She tripped over an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>antique <\/strong>vase and broke a piece off of it. As she was reading an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>excerpt <\/strong>from a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>lyric <\/strong>poem, she sneezed and tore a page of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>epic<\/strong>.<\/p><p>After the tour, Jen approached the queen to apologize. She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>Majesty<\/strong>. I was a terrible tour guide. Let me give you a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>refund<\/strong> for the money you spent.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The queen laughed. She said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my money back, Jen. I loved the tour. You just have to be a little more careful and work hard to become the best at your job. Hard work <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>precedes <\/strong>success.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Jen smiled and thanked the queen. She decided to be extra careful from then on. She was persistent and worked hard. In time, Jen became the best tour guide at the museum.<\/p>",

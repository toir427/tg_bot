St. Nicholas was a real person.<\/p><p>A long time ago, a man named Marcus <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>occupied<\/strong> a house with his family. He was not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>modest<\/strong>. He always told everybody he was the strongest man in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>province<\/strong>.<\/p><p>He worked hard, but he could barely <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>sustain<\/strong> his family. He wanted to save money and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>prosper<\/strong>. Still, he could never earn a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>penny<\/strong> more than he needed.<\/p><p>One day, Marcus made an agreement with a blacksmith. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>blacksmith<\/strong> had a lot of work to do. But he couldn&rsquo;t do it all by himself. Marcus wanted to help him <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>forge<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>iron<\/strong>. The blacksmith agreed to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>compensate<\/strong> him with a lot of money.<\/p><p>In the same town, there was a man named Nicholas. At an early age, Nicholas started <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>preaching<\/strong>. But he also believed that he should be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>humble<\/strong> and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>charitable<\/strong>. He learned that helping people gave him even more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>satisfaction<\/strong> than preaching.<\/p><p>One day, Nicholas <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>encountered<\/strong> Marcus. Marcus told Nicholas about his agreement with the blacksmith. &ldquo; I worked hard for him,&rdquo; Marcus said, &ldquo; but a problem <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>arose<\/strong>. Even though I worked for him, he didn&rsquo;t pay me.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Nicholas wanted to help Marcus. That night, he went back to Marcus&rsquo;s house. He brought a bag of gold. It <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>exceeded<\/strong> the amount that Marcus needed. Nicholas climbed up a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>ladder<\/strong> and dropped the bag of gold down the chimney. Marcus thanked his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>benefactor<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Soon, people found out about Nicholas&rsquo;s gift. He became well known and loved. Even today, people still give secret gifts to children. And we say they are from St. Nicholas.<\/p>",

He was sure never to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>overlook<\/strong> any of them. One night, he saw some wild sheep had joined his herd. He hoped to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acquire<\/strong> the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>newcomers<\/strong>.<\/p><p>It snowed that night. In the morning, the shepherd couldn&rsquo;t take his sheep out of his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>lodge<\/strong>. Instead, he had to feed them inside. He gave a small amount of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wheat<\/strong> to his own sheep. But he gave more of the food to the wild sheep. He thought the extra wheat would <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>discourage<\/strong> them from leaving.<\/p><p>It snowed for several days. During that time, the shepherd&rsquo;s sheep ate very little. The wild sheep, however, ate very well.<\/p><p>At last, the snow melted, and they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>ventured<\/strong> outdoors. As soon as he opened the door of his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>hut<\/strong>, the wild sheep started to run away.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Wait! This is how you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>repay<\/strong> me? After I treated you so kindly, why do you run away?&rdquo; the shepherd asked. His voice was full of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>hatred<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The wild sheep stopped and turned toward the shepherd.<\/p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving because you fed us better than your own sheep,&rdquo; one of the wild sheep replied. &ldquo;You tried to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>deceive<\/strong> us with your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>ridiculous<\/strong> plan. Yesterday you treated us kindly, but tomorrow you might be different. If more wild sheep joined your herd, you would treat us as <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>inferior<\/strong> sheep.&rdquo;<\/p><p>As the wild sheep ran away, the shepherd understood his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>offense<\/strong>. He knew this <strong  class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>awkward<\/strong> situation was his own fault. He had not been a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>satisfactory<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>caretaker<\/strong>. He was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>fake<\/strong> friend to the wild sheep. Because of this, he had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>neglected<\/strong> his own herd.<\/p>",

One day, Joe <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>offended<\/strong> Mike when he made fun of Mike&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>valentine<\/strong>, Jane. Mike felt <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>disgrace<\/strong>, but he didn&rsquo;t know how to make Joe stop.<\/p><p>That day, Mike walked home down an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>alley<\/strong>. He found a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bunch<\/strong> of wood boards next to a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>pine<\/strong> tree.

If I let Joe use it, he will be nicer to me and Jane.&rdquo; He took the wood home.<\/p><p>Mike got an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>ax<\/strong> and cut the wood. He used nails to make sure that the pieces were not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>loose<\/strong>. As he worked, he bumped his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>elbow<\/strong> on the boards.

I just built this sled, and I&rsquo;ll let you ride it with me if you are nice.&rdquo;<\/p><p>They became friends, and Joe was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>grateful<\/strong> that Mike was so nice to him. He learned that it is more fun to be nice than to be mean.<\/p>",

She always moved with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>grace<\/strong>. However, because of her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>compact<\/strong> size, she was scared of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>mankind<\/strong>.<\/p><p>One day, there was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>eclipse<\/strong> of the sun. The fairies didn&rsquo;t know what was happening. They were scared, so they ran away.<\/p><p>Tina looked for a place to hide. She found a garden with flowers <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>blooming<\/strong>. Tina had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>passion<\/strong> for flowers. She decided to hide there. She became sleepy and made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pillow<\/strong> with some leaves. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>whistled<\/strong> happily as she worked, and she fell asleep.<\/p><p>Suddenly, somebody <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>sneezed<\/strong>. The sound woke Tina up. She saw a very big face looking at her! Tina was so scared that she couldn&rsquo;t move. She could feel her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>pulse<\/strong> going very fast.<\/p><p>The big woman went into her house. When she came back, she gave Tina a cup.<\/p><p>The woman sat on the ground among some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>decaying<\/strong> leaves. Tina <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dipped<\/strong> a finger in the cup and tasted it. It was tea with all kinds of delicious <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>spices<\/strong> in it. Tina felt <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>refreshed<\/strong> after drinking the tea.<\/p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;m Wilma,&rdquo; the lady said. &ldquo; I spend all my <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>leisure<\/strong> time in my garden cutting flowers. Would you like some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dessert<\/strong>?&rdquo;<\/p><p>Tina said yes. She was hungry, and she wasn&rsquo;t frightened anymore. She took a bite of cake and relaxed. &ldquo; How did you get to my garden?&rdquo;<\/p><p>Tina told Wilma how she got lost.<\/p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible! Let us take you home.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I think that I want to stay with you,&rdquo; Tina said. She wasn&rsquo;t scared of big people anymore.

They thought the food <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>nourished<\/strong> them on their journey from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>cemeteries<\/strong> to heaven. People had to put out good things for souls to eat. However, if the food rotted or <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>spoiled<\/strong>, the soul got mad. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wicked<\/strong> soul might <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>curse<\/strong> the family and make them <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>starve<\/strong> during the winter.<\/p><p>In other places, people begged for food on a holiday that remembers the souls of dead saints. People wore <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>disguises<\/strong> with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>hoods<\/strong> that covered their faces. If they did not get food, they played a trick on the home. For this reason, the activity is known as &ldquo;trick-or- treating.&rdquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>Shortly<\/strong> after people first began trick-or-treating, parents started sending their children to beg on that day. Housewives gave the children food if they performed a song or a dance. When people moved to America from all over the world, they brought this tradition with them. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>Inhabitants<\/strong> of villages started trick-or-treating in the early 1900s. In 1939 a children&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>publication<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acquainted<\/strong> the whole country with the tradition. It became very popular.<\/p><p>Today, trick-or-treaters are not begging for food, and they are not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>scared<\/strong> of souls. They just enjoy the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>thrill<\/strong> of dressing up like creatures and getting candy. Ghosts and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>skeletons<\/strong> are favorite costumes. But some children wear <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>fancy<\/strong> disguises, like <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>pirates<\/strong>. They carry <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>flashlights<\/strong> instead of fires. In some places, children still perform songs or <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>riddles<\/strong> to get candy. But most of the time, they just say &ldquo;Trick-or-Treat!&rdquo;<\/p>",

He had more money than anyone in his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>district<\/strong>. One day, he was sitting on a chair listening to a radio <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>broadcast<\/strong>. As he listened to the news <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bulletin<\/strong>, a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>worm <\/strong>crawled from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>underneath <\/strong>the chair and onto his head.<\/p><p>His cook was in the kitchen <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>stirring <\/strong>some spaghetti sauce. Suddenly, a cry from the senator <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>alerted <\/strong>him. He ran to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>rear <\/strong>of the house where the senator was sitting.<\/p><p>The cook looked and saw the worm. He tried to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>console <\/strong>the senator. &ldquo; I&rsquo;ll take it off right away,&rdquo; he said.<\/p><p>&ldquo; No!&rdquo; shouted the senator. &ldquo; I want you to kill it.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo; But it&rsquo;s only a worm,&rdquo; the cook said. &ldquo; Why should we <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>execute <\/strong>it? It hasn&rsquo;t committed a crime.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The senator could not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>endure <\/strong>the worm on his head. &ldquo; Hurry!&rdquo; he shouted.<\/p><p>The cook looked through several <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>drawers<\/strong>, but found nothing. Then he ran to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>closet <\/strong>and took out a pipe. He returned to the senator and lifted the pipe over his head. He knew he couldn&rsquo;t just <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>tap <\/strong>the worm. He was going to hit it hard. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>grasped <\/strong>the pipe tightly.<\/p><p>&ldquo; What are you waiting for?&rdquo; said the senator. &ldquo; Kill it!&rdquo;<\/p><p>The cook swung the pipe at the senator&rsquo;s head.<\/p><p>&ldquo; Oh, no,&rdquo; the worm said. &ldquo; He&rsquo;s going to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>chop <\/strong>me in half.&rdquo; It jumped off the senator&rsquo;s head.<\/p><p>There was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>tremendous <\/strong>noise. &ldquo; Owww!&rdquo; cried the senator.<\/p><p>A <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>bump <\/strong>rose upon his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>skull<\/strong>. Meanwhile, the worm crawled outside.<\/p><p>&ldquo; That was close,&rdquo; said the worm. &ldquo; Instead of being nice, he wanted to hurt me. Now, that man has a big bump on his head.&rdquo;<\/p>",

Every day, she waited by the bay for ships returning from an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>expedition<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Patsy Ann was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>brilliant <\/strong>dog, and she was very unique. She was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>deaf<\/strong>. She couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bark<\/strong>, either. But she used all of her other <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>senses <\/strong>to know when a ship was near.<\/p><p>Patsy Ann lived on the streets. Her owners did not want her because she could not hear. So they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>abandoned <\/strong>her. She found <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>refuge <\/strong>in a fancy hotel. Guests <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>rubbed <\/strong>her back and scratched her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>chin<\/strong>. Many people gave her food. She became quite <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>overweight<\/strong>.<\/p><p>She became very famous. Visitors to Alaska were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>enthusiastic <\/strong>about meeting her. They brought presents for her. They liked seeing her and the feeling was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>mutual<\/strong>. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>mayor <\/strong>said Patsy Ann should be called the town&rsquo;s greeter*.<\/p><p>The people in town loved Patsy Ann, too, even though she lived on the streets. They were willing to fight to keep her. A new law made all dogs wear a collar and get shots. The mayor received many <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>complaints<\/strong>. People wanted Patsy Ann to be able to stay. One <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>ambitious <\/strong>sailor got people to help. Together, they paid for Patsy Ann to go to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>veterinarian<\/strong>. She got her shots and collar. She could stay.<\/p><p>When Patsy Ann died, everyone missed the town&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>loyal <\/strong>greeter. So the mayor hired someone to make a statue of Patsy Ann. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>restored <\/strong>the town&rsquo;s greeter. Now, she sits at the dock forever, waiting for ships to come home.<\/p><p><em>*greeter - a person whose job is to say hello to new people.<\/em><\/p>",

She only used beautiful <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>fabric <\/strong>to make clothes.<\/p><p>Since they didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money, they lived in an old <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>shed<\/strong>. Water <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>dripped <\/strong>in when it rained. They had broken chairs instead of a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>couch<\/strong>. But they had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>coal <\/strong>for heat, and flour from the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>mill <\/strong>for bread. Together, they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>trimmed <\/strong>the bushes to make their house look nice. Joe and Stella were poor, but not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>ashamed<\/strong>. They were happy.<\/p><p>Sometimes in the evening, they walked downtown. They looked in store windows and dreamed. Stella wanted a hairbrush with an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>ivory <\/strong>handle. She pulled her hair <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>upwards <\/strong>every day because she didn&rsquo;t have a brush to make it nice. Joe wanted to fix his grandfather&rsquo;s watch.<\/p><p>For their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>anniversary<\/strong>, Stella wanted to get Joe what he wanted. But then she did the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>arithmetic<\/strong>. It would take at least six months to save enough money. Then she had an idea. She cut off all of her hair and sold it.<\/p><p>Meanwhile, Joe knew that he could never fix his watch. So he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>polished <\/strong>it and sold it. He made enough to buy the brush.<\/p><p>On their anniversary, the door <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>burst <\/strong>open. Joe was excited to give Stella his gift. But first, Stella gave him the money to fix the watch. When he saw his wife without any hair, he smiled. &ldquo; I sold my watch to buy you something,&rdquo; Joe said. He gave her the brush, and she laughed. They were both willing to give up something very special to make each other happy.<\/p>",

He was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>bully <\/strong>who <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>boasted <\/strong>about his strength. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>quarreled <\/strong>with the other boys. Sometimes, if boys gave Mitch their lunch money, he would have <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>mercy <\/strong>and leave them alone.<\/p><p>One day, the boys learned about a special Middle School Olympics. Their gym class was going to be in it. Many kids were excited. But Dalton thought it sounded like <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>torture<\/strong>.<\/p><p>That morning, Dalton ate plenty of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>carbohydrates <\/strong>for breakfast. He entered the gym and looked at the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>dial <\/strong>on the clock. It was time to begin. The teacher asked if they were ready. Everyone <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>nodded<\/strong>, except Dalton.<\/p><p>&ldquo; I got <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>stung <\/strong>by a bee. I need to see the nurse.&rdquo; said Dalton. He made it up so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to play.<\/p><p>&ldquo; I don&rsquo;t believe you. Get ready to play,&rdquo; responded the coach.<\/p><p>First, they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wrestled<\/strong>. Then they jumped, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>crawled <\/strong>and played other games. But Mitch was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>dominant <\/strong>in every event.<\/p><p>They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>strained <\/strong>all morning to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>defeat <\/strong>him. By lunch, they were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sore<\/strong>. Their entire bodies <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>ailed <\/strong>them. They thought about how to win. They knew the last game of the day was volleyball. Kids who used to be Dalton&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>rivals <\/strong>became his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>allies<\/strong>. They wanted him to help them beat Mitch. Dalton was going to be Mitch&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>opponent<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The game started. Every time Mitch tried to hit the ball over the net, Dalton stopped it. Finally, Mitch used all of his strength. But the ball <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>bounced<\/strong> off Dalton&rsquo;s hands and back into Mitch&rsquo;s face! Finally Mitch was defeated.<\/p>",

He didn&rsquo;t see any <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>bamboo<\/strong>. Instead, there were bushes with long <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>leaves<\/strong>. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>ecosystem <\/strong>was now very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>abnormal<\/strong>. Peter knew he was in the Magic <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>Marsh<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Now he was tired and thirsty. He was afraid. Being lost in the marsh could be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>fatal<\/strong>. When people entered it, they never came out.<\/p><p>At last, he found a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>pond<\/strong>. Flowers grew around it. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>blossoms <\/strong>smelled like the best <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>perfume<\/strong>. He felt relaxed so he drank some water and fell asleep. When he awoke, he saw an evil <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>dwarf <\/strong>staring at him.<\/p><p>&ldquo; What are you doing here?&rdquo; it asked. The dwarf spoke in a strange <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dialect<\/strong>.<\/p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;m lost,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo; Can you help me?&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; it said, but Peter didn&rsquo;t know it was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dishonest<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The dwarf took an old <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>manuscript <\/strong>from his pocket. It was a magic map. &ldquo; Just <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>recite <\/strong>the words at the bottom,&rdquo; the dwarf explained. &ldquo; It will show you how to get home.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo; Good,&rdquo; Peter said. He was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>impatient <\/strong>and quickly grabbed the map.<\/p><p>He recited the magic words, and a line appeared on the map. He walked for many days but never left the marsh. Finally, the map led him back to the pond. He walked in a circle!<\/p><p>The dwarf was still there. &ldquo; Here&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>proverb <\/strong>for you to think about,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo; When patience is lost, the so are you.&rdquo;<\/p>",

When he reached the sidewalk, he caught the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>scent <\/strong>of ice cream cones and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>anticipated<\/strong> eating some ice cream.<\/p><p>Sam opened the door. Uncle John had a new, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>steel <\/strong>machine. &ldquo; What is that?&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo; It&rsquo;s a cone maker. I built it from a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>kit<\/strong>. You take flour from the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>barrel <\/strong>and put it in this pan,&rdquo; Uncle John said. &ldquo; Then add water and sugar here and stir it so the sugar <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>dissolves<\/strong>. Next, you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>fasten <\/strong>down the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>beam<\/strong>.&rdquo; Uncle John wanted to look <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>casual<\/strong>, but he was excited. He made a few <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>swift <\/strong>motions and turned it on. There was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>puff <\/strong>of smoke, and then cones came out the other end.<\/p><p>&ldquo; Is it hard to use? Sam asked.<\/p><p>&ldquo; On the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>contrary<\/strong>. It&rsquo;s easy to use. Want to try?&rdquo;<\/p><p>Sam washed his hands with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>caution<\/strong>. He made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>deliberate <\/strong>attempt to keep <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>germs <\/strong>out of the dough. Soon, Sam had his first cone. He smiled in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>triumph<\/strong>!<\/p><p>Uncle John tried to turn the machine off, but it just kept making cones. Sam and Uncle John put them on the counter, then on chairs. Before long, cones <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>scattered <\/strong>all over the floor.<\/p><p>They tried everything to stop it, but it wouldn&rsquo;t stop! &ldquo; What are we going to do?&rdquo; he said.<\/p><p>&ldquo; Kick it!&rdquo; yelled Sam. Uncle John lifted his foot and gave the machine a kick. It made a funny noise and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>exploded<\/strong>. They were both covered with dough*. Uncle John laughed when he knew Sam was OK. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tossed <\/strong>Sam a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>rag <\/strong>to clean his face and smiled. &ldquo; I guess we have enough cones now!&rdquo;<\/p>",

Dan <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>enforced <\/strong>cruel laws. Once, Dan even put his own brother in jail for throwing a coin into a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>fountain<\/strong>!

He didn&rsquo;t want the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bullets <\/strong>to hit anyone.

Dan yelled, &ldquo; Get your hands off of me! I&rsquo;ll put you all in jail for the rest of your lives!&rdquo;<\/p><p>The crowd didn&rsquo;t listen.

Dan was so scared that he began to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sweat<\/strong>. He begged, &ldquo; If you let me go, I will give you all my money!&rdquo;<\/p><p>The crowd said back, &ldquo; Sheriff, we don&rsquo;t care about your money. We know you will never change. We&rsquo;re sending you on a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>voyage <\/strong>to the middle of the ocean.&rdquo; The boat <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>drifted <\/strong>out of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>port<\/strong>, and Dan was never seen again.

Then they could become the leader.<\/p><p>They both left to find the cup. Before their trip, their mother said they should work together. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dismissed <\/strong>that idea. Even though their trips <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>originated <\/strong>from the same house, each wanted to travel alone.<\/p><p>They were both <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>miserable <\/strong>during the trip. They had to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>navigate <\/strong>small boats across <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>shallow <\/strong>rivers and climb difficult <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>slopes<\/strong>. Their journey <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>spanned <\/strong>many days. When they finally got close to the volcano, the ground began to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>vibrate <\/strong>and the volcano <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>erupted<\/strong>. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>Ash <\/strong>filled the sky and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>lava<\/strong> covered everything. John climbed to the top of a hill to keep from getting burned. A few moments later, his brother went up the same hill. They were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>confined <\/strong>to the hill until the lava cooled down.<\/p><p>They talked about the things they had seen while <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wandering <\/strong>around the country. They felt more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>sympathy <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>affection <\/strong>for each other than ever before. They decided that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>fate <\/strong>had brought them together.<\/p><p>The next day they left to finish the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>remainder <\/strong>of the trip together. Everything seemed much easier. When they finally found the cup, they learned that it didn&rsquo;t make wishes come true. It was only an ordinary cup.

They didn&rsquo;t have enough <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>warriors <\/strong>to stop them, so they asked a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>knight <\/strong>for help.<\/p><p>The knight made a plan. A tall mountain was outside the town. The road near the top was very narrow. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>Cliffs <\/strong>rose on both sides of it.<\/p><p>&ldquo; We must trick the enemy.

Also, only a few could attack because the path was narrow. The knight and the warriors fought the enemy. But there were too many troops.<\/p><p>The knight was afraid. If the warriors <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>yielded <\/strong>the path to the enemy, the town would be lost.<\/p><p>A storm suddenly came over the mountain.

A mean farmer named Jack yelled, &ldquo; Pears for sale!&rdquo; He sat on a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>bench<\/strong>, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>plotting <\/strong>how he could trick people. Then an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>orphan <\/strong>came to his cart.<\/p><p>&ldquo; Can you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>spare <\/strong>a pear?&rdquo; she asked.<\/p><p>Jack felt <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>rage<\/strong>. He replied, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any money!&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo; Please, I haven&rsquo;t had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>supper <\/strong>in days.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo; No!&rdquo; shouted the farmer.<\/p><p>The orphan <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sighed<\/strong>. However, a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>pregnant <\/strong>lady heard the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>dispute <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>confronted <\/strong>Jack. &ldquo; Just give her a pear,&rdquo; she said. Jack had no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>shame<\/strong> and said no. Finally, a man bought a pear for the girl.<\/p><p>The girl quickly ate it, but she saved the seed. She wanted to get <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>revenge<\/strong>.<\/p><p>She told Jack, &ldquo; I know a way to get hundreds of pears in one day. I&rsquo;ll show you how.&rdquo;<\/p><p>He watched the girl dig a hole. She dropped the seed into the ground. Then she spread the dirt over it.<\/p><p>&ldquo; Watch closely,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo; In a few minutes, a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>stem <\/strong>will grow. It&rsquo;ll turn into a tree that&rsquo;s full of pears!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Jack stared at the dirt, but nothing happened. The only <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>objects <\/strong>there were a few <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>daisies<\/strong>. He looked for the girl, but she had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>snuck <\/strong>away.<\/p><p>Then he looked at his cart in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>horror<\/strong>. It was empty! He suddenly realized that the orphan had tricked him. While Jack was waiting for the tree to grow, the people had taken the pears from his cart. They all laughed while they were eating the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tender <\/strong>fruit. The farmer felt ashamed. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>incident <\/strong>taught him to be kinder.<\/p>",

Then one day a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>messenger <\/strong>came to the ranch. He showed the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>headline <\/strong>in the town newspaper. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>circus <\/strong>was coming to the town. It even <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>coincided <\/strong>with Ben&rsquo;s birthday!<\/p><p>Ben was very excited as his father <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>steered <\/strong>the car through the town. The circus couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accommodate <\/strong>all the people who wanted to see the show, but Ben had a ticket.<\/p><p>Ben <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>peered <\/strong>at the activity around him. He watched people of both <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>genders <\/strong>dance all around. They wore funny costumes, and their hair was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dyed<\/strong> many different colors. Also, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tame <\/strong>tigers with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>stripes <\/strong>on their fur did tricks. Outside, people could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>commission <\/strong>an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>informal<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>portrait<\/strong>. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>posed <\/strong>in front of a funny picture while an artist quickly drew them. Ben couldn&rsquo;t believe it. He was happier than he had ever been before.<\/p><p>That day, Ben knew what he wanted to do. He loved the circus to such an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>extent <\/strong>that he wanted to have his own circus when he grew older.<\/p><p>Seeing the circus was like a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dose <\/strong>of medicine for him. He wasn&rsquo;t unhappy anymore. He felt special. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>inquired <\/strong>about what he needed to do to have his own circus. He studied hard and learned about business.<\/p><p>Ben worked very hard, and one day, he had his own circus. It was a great circus. People told him that he could be very rich. But he wasn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tempted<\/strong> by money. He just wanted to make children happy. He knew the circus had changed his life, and he wanted to do the same thing for others.<\/p>",

We&rsquo;ll go with you, and we can perform our <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>symphony <\/strong>there,&rdquo; Lester said.<\/p><p>The animals put together a small <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bundle <\/strong>that held a drum, a flute and a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>portable <\/strong>microphone. Then they took their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>baggage <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>initiated <\/strong>their long journey.<\/p><p>They walked down a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>paved<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>lane <\/strong>all day. That night, they looked in the window of a house. They saw a group of thieves. They were eating a large dinner and telling stories about their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>greed <\/strong>and the people they stole from.<\/p><p>Lester was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>optimist<\/strong>. He said, &ldquo; I think we can scare them away!&rdquo;<\/p><p>Soon, the animals came up with a plan. Harry flew inside and knocked over the lamp. &ldquo; What was that?&rdquo; screamed a thief as the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>bulb <\/strong>broke. They could barely see now.<\/p><p>Then Larry stood on two feet, and Lester flew to the top of his head. They looked very big. All three of the animals made scary noises. The thieves tried to hit the animals. But Harry flew over them and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>scratched <\/strong>them.<\/p><p>&ldquo; It&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>phantom<\/strong>!&rdquo; yelled one thief.<\/p><p>The thieves ran away. The animals ate and rested. The next morning, Larry said, &ldquo;Why go to Bremen? We can stay here and make music!&rdquo; And so they remained there and were quite happy.<\/p>",

As a result, it&rsquo;s covered with snow, ice and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>frost<\/strong>. Then how was the name <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>derived<\/strong>? It started with a Viking named Erik the Red. Erik had many <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>merits<\/strong>. However, there was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>underlying<\/strong> problem . . . he got angry easily. People were scared of him. However, he was married to the niece of a very powerful man. So everybody tried to be nice to him.<\/p><p>One day, Erik fought with his neighbor and killed him. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>consequent <\/strong>punishment was to leave Iceland.<\/p><p>Many stories <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>circulated <\/strong>about a land west of Iceland. But only a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>fraction <\/strong>of the people in Iceland believed them. Still, Erik wanted to find it.<\/p><p>Erik sailed toward the land <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>via <\/strong>the Atlantic Ocean. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>marine <\/strong>knowledge was good, but the trip was hard. Some of his men <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>drowned<\/strong>. Erik&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>lieutenant <\/strong>wanted to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>resign <\/strong>from his position. Others thought about committing <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>suicide<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Suddenly, Erik thought he saw something. &ldquo; I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Erik. &ldquo; It must be an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>illusion<\/strong>.&rdquo; But it was no trick&mdash;it was the new land!<\/p><p>Erik <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>trembled <\/strong>in the cold <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>polar <\/strong>air. He saw that there was ice everywhere. He realized that the ice could keep enemies out. Not even the best <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>navy <\/strong>could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>invade <\/strong>the new land. He could start a new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dynasty <\/strong>in his name. But how could he convince people to live here?<\/p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;ll call it &lsquo;Greenland,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.

One <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>autumn <\/strong>day, I was sure I would make my parents proud. I bought a model rocket. After I put it together, I invited everybody to watch it. I wanted my brothers to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>envy <\/strong>my technical knowledge. I lit the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>fuse<\/strong>, but nothing happened.<\/p><p>&ldquo; Looks like your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>fireworks <\/strong>don&rsquo;t work.

I quickly moved the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wires <\/strong>on the bottom, hoping that would help. Suddenly, the rocket flew up.

It got there when the Spanish <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>conquered <\/strong>parts of South America. The Spanish <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>noble<\/strong>, Francisco Pizarro, arrived in Peru in the 1500s. He found a group of people called the Incas. The Incas believed that their leader, Atahualpa, was both a king and a god. But Pizarro didn&rsquo;t agree.<\/p><p>&ldquo; It is a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sin <\/strong>for a man to think he is God!&rdquo; he said to Atahualpa.<\/p><p>Atahualpa thought Pizarro was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>insulting <\/strong>his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>heritage<\/strong>. He thought the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>blonde <\/strong>Spanish men held <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>prejudices <\/strong>against the Incas. But Atahualpa was a kind man and didn&rsquo;t want to fight the Spaniards. He said, &ldquo; If I give you a room full of gold, will you leave my country in peace?&rdquo;<\/p><p>Pizarro was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>suspicious<\/strong>. He thought Atahualpa was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>exaggerating<\/strong>. But a few days later, Pizarro returned to the Inca palace with his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>ambassadors<\/strong>. He saw a room filled with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>stacks <\/strong>of gold. There were golden <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>necklaces<\/strong>, cups, plates and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vases<\/strong>. It was a great <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>spectacle<\/strong>. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acknowledged <\/strong>that Atahualpa had told the truth. But after seeing the gold, he wanted all of Peru&rsquo;s gold. So he didn&rsquo;t leave the country.<\/p><p>The Spanish soldiers stayed in Peru and grabbed all the gold they could find. But the Inca people tricked the Spaniards. They mixed the gold with tin so that it was poor quality. They gave this gold to the Spaniards. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>Meanwhile<\/strong>, they hid the good gold. They stuffed it into sacks and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dragged <\/strong>it deep into the jungle. The Spanish conquerors never found the gold. People think it is still there today.<\/p>",

He was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>stubborn <\/strong>boy, and he only cared about himself. His father worked as a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>chemist <\/strong>for an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>institution <\/strong>and wanted Marcus to get a job there. Instead, the boy delivered milk. Each morning he took <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>dairy <\/strong>products to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>grocers<\/strong>.<\/p><p>One day, Marcus was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>jogging <\/strong>down the street with a gallon of milk to give to a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>merchant<\/strong>. He didn&rsquo;t want to be late. He ran down a path beside a large <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>canal<\/strong>. A wall there kept water from coming into the town during high <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tide<\/strong>. But Marcus saw a small hole in the wall. Marcus knew that if the wall broke, it would be a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tragedy <\/strong>for the town.<\/p><p>At first, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>hesitated<\/strong>. He had to choose between helping himself and helping the town. There was only one way to save the town. It seemed crazy to him, but it was the only thing he could do. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>poked <\/strong>his finger into the hole. This didn&rsquo;t fix the problem forever, but it did <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>postpone <\/strong>the tragedy.<\/p><p>His finger <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>ached<\/strong>. He felt the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>chill <\/strong>of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>arctic <\/strong>water as it <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>splashed <\/strong>him. There was no one else around. He knew he had to wait until the tide <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>descended<\/strong>. It was very difficult, but Marcus stayed there and saved the town.<\/p><p>Once the tide had descended, Marcus told everyone what happened. A group of people went to the wall. They saw the hole and fixed it. Everyone was very happy with Marcus. The local <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>congress <\/strong>even gave him a gift for saving the town. He was a hero.<\/p>",

One day, Cory the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>caterpillar<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>emerged <\/strong>from a hole in the wall while Katie was playing in the living room.<\/p><p>&ldquo; Hey!&rdquo; Katie yelled. &ldquo; Do you want to play with me?&rdquo;<\/p><p>Cory was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>reluctant<\/strong>. He said, &ldquo; I&rsquo;d rather not play with you. I have several <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>handicaps<\/strong>. My body is very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>delicate<\/strong>. Your claws are as sharp as <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>hooks<\/strong>. You might cut me. Plus, I have no bones, not even a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>spine<\/strong>. You could easily hurt me.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo; I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>swear <\/strong>that I won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; Katie said.<\/p><p>&ldquo; No, I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he said again. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>hopped <\/strong>from the wall, but Katie <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>pursued <\/strong>him.<\/p><p>Cory ran into the kitchen and into the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>cupboard<\/strong>, but Katie chased closely behind. Katie knocked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>appliances <\/strong>to the floor. Plates fell into the sink and broke in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>basin<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Then he ran into a bedroom. Some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>laundry <\/strong>was on the floor. Cory hid under a shirt, but Katie saw him. She jumped on the shirt. Her paws left <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>stains <\/strong>on the cloth, and her claws ripped the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>sleeves <\/strong>into <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>strips<\/strong>.<\/p><p>However, Cory escaped. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>utilized <\/strong>a small crack in the floor to hide. But Katie saw him.<\/p><p>&ldquo; Now you are trapped!&rdquo; said Katie.<\/p><p>Cory tried to avoid Katie&rsquo;s claws. He moved his body as far into the hole as possible. He didn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;d get out of the hole.<\/p><p>Just then, Katie&rsquo;s owner came home. She saw that the house was a mess. She took a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>broom <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>swung <\/strong>it at Katie. She chased Katie out of the house.<\/p><p>Cory was safe, and Katie was left outside because she didn&rsquo;t listen to the wishes of others.<\/p>",

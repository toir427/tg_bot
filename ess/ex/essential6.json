                    "story": "<p>Among the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>multitude <\/strong>of stars in the universe, there are a couple that are of great importance to people on Earth. The sun, of course, is one of them. The other is known as Polaris, the North Star. Polaris is special because it is the only star that always appears to be in the same place in the sky. Therefore, Polaris is a great compass. When people in the northern hemisphere of Earth look toward Polaris, they can be certain that they are facing north. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>permanence <\/strong>of Polaris in the north sky has helped countless people find their destinations.<\/p><p>Before the invention of modern navigation tools, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>mariners <\/strong>relied on Polaris. From the top of their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>hulls<\/strong>, sailors would look for Polaris to figure out their place at sea. They figured out the angle between the star and the horizon to determine their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>latitude<\/strong>. As long as the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>equations <\/strong>weren&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>erroneous<\/strong>, the results were very reliable. Polaris also let sailors determine North, South, East, and West. By knowing directions and their location, mariners could easily navigate their ships.<\/p><p>To those who sail at night, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>volatile <\/strong>storms and dark clouds were more than <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>nuisances<\/strong>. They could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>disrupt <\/strong>entire journeys by blocking the view of Polaris. A captain could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>err <\/strong>and make an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>inadvertent <\/strong>wrong turn. The ship could become <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>stranded <\/strong>at sea, and the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>frantic <\/strong>captain would have no way to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>improvise <\/strong>to get the ship back on the right course. The mariner&rsquo;s fears wouldn&rsquo;t be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>soothed <\/strong>until the clouds cleared and Polaris came back into view. Even today, sailors sometimes opt to navigate by using Polaris on clear nights.<\/p><p>It&rsquo;s not difficult to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>differentiate <\/strong>Polaris from other stars. The Big Dipper, a constellation that is well known in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>astrology<\/strong>, appears to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>revolve <\/strong>around Polaris. The handle of the Big Dipper always points to the North Star. When people get lost, it&rsquo;s comforting to know that their problems can be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>alleviated <\/strong>by looking at the sky.<\/p>",

Although Tim and Dean were quite similar, they were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>outright <\/strong>enemies. The two men got into <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vicious <\/strong>arguments all the time. They couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>coexist <\/strong>peacefully because their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>egos <\/strong>were too large. Tim thought he was the best fossil hunter, while Dean was sure that he was much better than Tim.<\/p><p>One day, Tim was searching for fossils on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>periphery <\/strong>of the city when he discovered a huge bone. He had never seen anything like it! He took his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>shovel <\/strong>and carefully <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>excavated <\/strong>the dirt around it. As he dug, he uncovered more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>jagged <\/strong>bones. He realized that he had found an entire dinosaur <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>skeleton<\/strong>! Tim couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>conceive <\/strong>a plan to remove the huge skeleton all by himself. Such an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>endeavor <\/strong>would be too <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>arduous<\/strong>. He needed help. He tried to think of people who would be capable of helping him remove the skeleton without breaking it. The only person Tim could think of was Dean, his enemy.<\/p><p>Tim ran into the city to find Dean. Tim found him and said, &ldquo; Dean, I&rsquo;ve found the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>skeletal <\/strong>remains of a huge <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>terrestrial <\/strong>animal. But I can&rsquo;t get the skeleton out by myself. Will you please help me?<\/p><p>Dean thought that Tim&rsquo;s claim might be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dubious<\/strong>. He replied, &ldquo; If you&rsquo;re serious about the skeleton, I&rsquo;ll help.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Tim excitedly showed Dean the skeleton&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>locale<\/strong>. They worked together to carefully remove each bone. And to keep the bones together, they tied them with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>elastic <\/strong>strips. When they were finished, they had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>attained <\/strong>a perfect skeleton. They used <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>plaster <\/strong>to make a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>mold <\/strong>of the dinosaur&rsquo;s skull. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>engraved <\/strong>their initials into it and gave it to the curator of a local museum.<\/p><p>Tim and Dean found out that they could work very well together. They decided to end their feud and become friends. By combining their talents, the men became even greater than they were before.<\/p>",

Soon you&rsquo;d realize, though, that the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>aristocrats <\/strong>of Europe were very serious about their appearance.<\/p><p>The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>predominant <\/strong>style in women&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>attire <\/strong>was enormous dresses. They were often three times larger than the wearer. Ladies even used <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>pads<\/strong> to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>enlarge <\/strong>the appearance of their hips and shoulders. On the other extreme, the aristocratic women made their waists appear extremely thin. It took several maids stretching fabric and pulling <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>straps <\/strong>in order to get a lady&rsquo;s waist to the proper thinness. These ladies could barely breathe and often fainted.<\/p><p>Pale skin was also a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>craze<\/strong>, yet this too was done in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>excess<\/strong>. One could not simply be pale. Instead, she needed to look as if she had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>anemia<\/strong>. In order to look paler, ladies actually cut themselves daily, so they would bleed.<\/p><p>The hairstyles, however, were the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>hallmark <\/strong>of women&rsquo;s fashion. These stood a meter high on the ladies&rsquo; heads. The columns of hair were a ridiculous <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>tangle <\/strong>of wigs, jewels, flowers, and even stuffed birds.<\/p><p>Men&rsquo;s fashion was similarly <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>absurd<\/strong>. Today it would probably seem very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>feminine<\/strong>. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>Reputable <\/strong>men wore wigs of long curly hair. Their shoes had large soles or high heels so that they could walk high above the filth on the streets. Furthermore, just like the ladies, the men wore lipstick and put <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>rouge <\/strong>on their cheeks.<\/p><p>Their clothes were brightly colored, often purple and pink. They were made from the finest of fabrics and decorated with jewels and lace. The men <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>vied <\/strong>with one another to see who wore the more expensive clothes, for the clothing <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>signified <\/strong>his wealth and status.<\/p><p>Both men and women spent huge amounts of money and time on how they looked. Though such <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>vanity <\/strong>would seem <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vulgar <\/strong>today, three hundred years from now, the fashions of our time might also seem completely ridiculous.<\/p>",

He worked all day organizing the superintendent&rsquo;s parties and then cleaned up after them late at night. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>Hence<\/strong>, while the superintendent slept <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>soundly<\/strong>, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>snoring <\/strong>loudly in his bed, the butler was still awake.<\/p><p>Sadly, though the butler was always <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>overworked<\/strong>, his profession&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>intrinsic <\/strong>nature demanded he never be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>outspoken<\/strong>. Therefore, his employer never knew the butler hadn&rsquo;t slept for several days. On any day the butler might make a mistake.<\/p><p>One day, the superintendent said, &ldquo;This <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>particular <\/strong>party is important.

But on his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>descent<\/strong>, he realized he needed to make the food. A <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>gourmet <\/strong>dinner was necessary for such a party. He boiled water in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>kettle <\/strong>for soup and chopped some beef into <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>chunks<\/strong>. Just as he was starting the soup, he remembered that he had to sweep the veranda. As he was sweeping the veranda, he realized that he had to clean the sauna.<\/p><p>By this time, the first guests had arrived. The veranda was still dirty. There were not enough chairs for the guests to sit on, and the soup tasted too <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>pungent<\/strong>. Some guests were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dissatisfied<\/strong>. They started to make a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>fuss<\/strong>, and the party was filled with a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>din <\/strong>of complaints.<\/p><p>The superintendent&rsquo;s party was a disaster. He wondered why his butler had made so many mistakes. At last, the butler admitted to being exhausted. His boss felt pity for the butler. He had no idea the butler was so tired. He said, &ldquo;You should have told me earlier, then we could have avoided this whole <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>ordeal<\/strong>.&rdquo;<\/p>",

She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>negotiated <\/strong>the details. &ldquo;What will the winner get?&rdquo; she asked.<\/p><p>&ldquo;The loser has to carry the winner&rsquo;s books for a year! I&rsquo;ll even let you go first.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Becky replied, &ldquo; Fine, but to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>clarify<\/strong>, you&rsquo;ll carry my books for the entire school year, right?&rdquo;<\/p><p>Russell <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>restated <\/strong>the agreement, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right I&rsquo;ll carry your books all year if you win&mdash;which you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;<\/p><p>His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dogged<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>persuasion <\/strong>convinced her. The chili looked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>benign<\/strong>, but Becky knew it could cause a lot of pain. She bit the bottom of the pepper. Surprisingly, she felt nothing.<\/p><p>&ldquo; My turn,&rdquo; said Russell. He bit the middle of the chili. Immediately, he seemed to be in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>distress<\/strong>. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>gasped <\/strong>and his face <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>alternated <\/strong>between brave and pained expressions. He experienced an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>overdose <\/strong>of spice. He was on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>verge <\/strong>of tears and finally let out a horrible cry.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; said Becky, handing him her drink.<\/p><p>&ldquo;That was awful!&rdquo; he said, continuing to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>sip <\/strong>from the glass.<\/p><p>That night, Becky researched chilies. The next day she said in an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>apologetic <\/strong>voice, &ldquo; I read that the hot part of chilies is in the middle, where the seeds are. I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;I feel like I cheated by going first.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Russell was relieved, not only did he learn something new about chilies, but he learned that Becky was a good friend.<\/p>",

                    "story": "<p>Once, a British <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>gazette <\/strong>had an unusual story. Scientists at a zoo made a discovery about komodo dragons. Komodo dragons are giant lizards that grow up to two and a half meters long. A female lizard at the zoo had babies. However, it had never been around a male lizard in its entire life. After the scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>publicized <\/strong>their discovery, many people thought it was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>fictitious<\/strong>.<\/p><p>But it was true. It was discovered that female komodo dragons can have babies without the help of their male <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>counterparts<\/strong>. This <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>contradicts <\/strong>what scientists know about how most animals have babies.<\/p><p>In most cases, there are many things that can <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>obstruct <\/strong>this type of reproduction. For example, adult males and females carry different genes needed to make an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>embryo<\/strong>. If the genes are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>homogeneous<\/strong>, the babies are weaker and have genetic problems. Over time, the weakened species dies out completely. This makes it necessary for the male to be involved. However, scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>verified <\/strong>that when Komodo babies are born, their genes aren&rsquo;t the exact same genes as their mother. Also, they are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>devoid <\/strong>of any genetic problems.<\/p><p>Scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>theorize <\/strong>that Komodo dragons developed the ability because it helps the species <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>fend <\/strong>off extinction. If a volcano erupts, lava can kill all of the komodo dragons on an island. However, as long as one female <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>eludes <\/strong>death, she can <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>prolong <\/strong>the survival of the species. Luckily, Komodo dragons are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vigorous <\/strong>swimmers. So the surviving female can <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>plunge <\/strong>into the ocean and swim to another island. When she comes <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>ashore<\/strong>, she can reproduce by herself. Over time, the genes within the population <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>diverge<\/strong>. Then, the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sparse <\/strong>population increases. Once again there is a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>surplus <\/strong>of lizards on one island. Scientists think that this may be how the lizards took over all of the islands in that area.<\/p>",

After it was found in the Egyptian desert, it took experts years to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>decipher <\/strong>it. The text was written in at least three different ancient languages. After many years, experts realized it contained a number of spells that varied greatly in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>scope<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The most common types of magic in the collection dealt with healing illnesses like <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pneumonia<\/strong>. Some spells also gave advice for treating people with mental illnesses, such as those who became <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>psychotic<\/strong>. Some spells asked for unusual things, like crocodile <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>dung<\/strong>. But <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>botany <\/strong>was an important part of the magic. Many healing spells gave instructions on how to use herbs and plants that were believed to be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>therapeutic<\/strong>. For example, in order to cure <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>arthritis<\/strong>, the book says that the magician should build an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>ornate<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>altar<\/strong>. Then he should <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>mash <\/strong>different types of herbs and place them on top of it. At dusk, he is supposed to say a spell, so the gods would be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>gratified<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Other parts of the collection describe how to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>hone <\/strong>one&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>psychic <\/strong>abilities and how to give <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>credible <\/strong>descriptions of the future. Often, the book advised people how to use different objects to tell the future, including tea leaves. Also, one part of the book tells what different dreams might mean. It gives advice for using dreams to tell the future.<\/p><p>A small part of the book, however, is more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>sinister <\/strong>than the rest. It is meant to cause <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>strife <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>deception<\/strong>. For example, one tells how to give someone warts, while another will make all of the victim&rsquo;s farm animals die. However, if someone&rsquo;s farm animals died as a result of a curse, he could ask a magician to perform magic that makes the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>deceased <\/strong>come back to life.<\/p>",

He had been hired as a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>courier <\/strong>for an important broker. All he needed to do was deliver a package to an office in New York City; the ship would take him there.<\/p><p>When he boarded, the ship was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>congested <\/strong>with people. As Kevin walked to his cabin, he saw the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>exclusive <\/strong>first-class section. Everybody inside was wearing fancy <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>garments<\/strong>. He would have liked to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>socialize <\/strong>with the people inside, but it was against proper <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>etiquette<\/strong>. People paid a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>premium <\/strong>for the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>privilege <\/strong>to ride in first-class.<\/p><p>Instead, he went to his cabin next to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>freight <\/strong>section of the boat. His room smelled bad, and the floorboards were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>warped <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>deformed <\/strong>in some areas. He could also hear the motor humming as it waited to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>propel <\/strong>the ship forward. Suddenly, Kevin was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>unsettled <\/strong>by something, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure why.<\/p><p>He took a short walk on the ship&rsquo;s deck, but he still felt strange. That night, he suffered from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>insomnia<\/strong>&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>suppress <\/strong>his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>obsessing<\/strong> over how strange he felt.<\/p><p>Kevin went back on deck. It was cold and dark outside. He looked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>overboard<\/strong>, but it seemed that everything was all right. &ldquo;Just go back inside,&rdquo; he thought. Then Kevin saw it. A giant iceberg was sticking out of the ocean in the distance!<\/p><p>&ldquo; Help!&rdquo; he yelled.<\/p><p>People looked at him as if he was crazy, but he continued to shout until he saw the captain.<\/p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an iceberg out there,&rdquo; Kevin said to him. &ldquo; If the ship doesn&rsquo;t move, we&rsquo;re <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>liable <\/strong>to crash,&rdquo; he said, pointing toward the iceberg.<\/p><p>The captain saw it and immediately instructed the crew to change the ship&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;Without your help, we would have definitely hit the iceberg. That would have been a terrible disaster!&rdquo; he said to Kevin.<\/p><p>Kevin felt relieved. Now he knew to always trust his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>intuitive <\/strong>sense.<\/p>",

                    "story": "<p>There are many animals with dangerous bites in the world, but which one is the worst? Some would say that the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>elusive <\/strong>short-tailed mamushi has the worst bite. The snake only goes into homes to chase <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pests <\/strong>such as mice. Otherwise, it stays in the fields, where it&rsquo;s dangerous to people who <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>forage <\/strong>for food there. If someone <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>stuns <\/strong>it by accidentally stepping on it, it bites to protect itself. At first, the effects of the bite may seem <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>negligible<\/strong> because it doesn&rsquo;t cause a lot of bleeding. However, after a few moments, the venom <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>induces<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>paralysis <\/strong>in the area where the individual was bitten. Furthermore, the venom can also <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>impede<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>respiration<\/strong>. If the person doesn&rsquo;t go to the doctor, they are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>susceptible <\/strong>to kidney <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>deterioration<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Others would argue that tigers have the worst bite. Mother tigers are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>inseparable <\/strong>from their babies and seem to be the gentlest creatures when they are around their young. However, if the babies are threatened, the mother tiger&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>savage <\/strong>nature <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>prevails<\/strong>. With strong jaws and the ability to move quickly, the tiger can kill someone with one bite. That&rsquo;s because it always tries to bite an important <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>artery <\/strong>when it attacks. If the artery is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>ruptured<\/strong>, the victim will bleed to death.<\/p><p>In the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>mainstream<\/strong>, animal bites are seen as the most dangerous. But some scientists think this idea is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>invalid<\/strong>. In fact, the most dangerous bite might be the human bite. When scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>magnified <\/strong>the contents in human saliva, they found about three hundred different <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>microbes <\/strong>in it. A human bite can be dangerous if the bacteria enters the body through a cut, which can make people very sick. Furthermore, most people don&rsquo;t realize how serious a man bit can be, so they don&#39;t go to the doctor right away. This gives the wound a chance to get infected and cause more problems.<\/p>",

Because of his job, he was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>secluded <\/strong>in a cabin in the wilderness.<\/p><p>One day, the radio reported, &ldquo;<strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>Convection <\/strong>in the atmosphere is causing a lot of clouds to form. A serious storm ...&rdquo; Suddenly, the radio went silent. The signal was lost.<\/p><p>He went outside and looked at the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>overcast <\/strong>sky. Anybody else would have taken the dark sky as an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>omen <\/strong>of a very bad storm, but not Randy. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>upbringing <\/strong>had taught him <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>consistency<\/strong>. He had done this job for years, and nothing could stop him. Besides, he thought nothing could hurt him.<\/p><p>Today, he had a very important task to do. The snow was starting to pile up high on the mountain. If too much <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accumulated<\/strong>, it could cause an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>avalanche<\/strong>. But Randy had an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>apparatus <\/strong>to get rid of the snow. It used dynamite to shake the snow and make the top * layer of snow come down.<\/p><p>As the snow started falling, he thought about returning to the office until the storm stopped, but he decided not to. Suddenly, he heard a loud noise behind him. It was an avalanche! He started to run, but within seconds, he was knocked <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sideways <\/strong>and buried by the snow and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>rubble<\/strong> from an old cabin that had been destroyed. An <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>aerial <\/strong>rescue team came quickly. Randy was just a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>speck <\/strong>amongst the great pile of snow, but the team found him thanks to his brightly colored jacket. They quickly took him to a hospital.<\/p><p>After a few hours, Randy woke up in the hospital. He looked at the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>sober <\/strong>faces of the doctors and saw his wife <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>sobbing<\/strong>.<\/p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked. He didn&rsquo;t remember what had happened.<\/p><p>&ldquo;You were almost killed!&rdquo; his wife said.<\/p><p>&ldquo;You broke several ribs. But the rest of you is still reasonably <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>intact<\/strong>. You are really lucky to be alive,&rdquo; the doctor said.<\/p><p>After five days, Randy was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>discharged <\/strong>from the hospital. The experience had taught him a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>poignant <\/strong>lesson: he was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>mortal<\/strong>, and nature was much more powerful than him.<\/p>",

Many people were very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>envious <\/strong>of him.<\/p><p>One day, a messenger <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>disclosed <\/strong>some interesting news: political <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>unrest <\/strong>in Persia had weakened the empire. Before then, the Persians had taken over many countries. Many leaders were scared of the Persian <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>conquest<\/strong>. But King Croesus understood the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>dynamics <\/strong>of war better than most. He decided that it would be a good time to try to beat the Persians while they were weak.<\/p><p>He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>advocated <\/strong>starting war, but nobody shared his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>sentiment<\/strong>. Then he asked a wise member of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>senate <\/strong>who was visiting from Athens. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>sage <\/strong>didn&rsquo;t say whether he should attack the Persians or not. He only warned him that his good luck wouldn&rsquo;t last.<\/p><p>Finally, King Croesus sent a messenger to visit the Oracle, a special lady who could see % the future. The messenger gave the Oracle jugs of wine and baskets of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>lentils <\/strong>in order to make her happy.<\/p><p>When the messenger came back, he was in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>festive <\/strong>mood.<\/p><p>&ldquo;What was the Oracle&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>prophecy<\/strong>?&rdquo; asked King Croesus.<\/p><p>The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>jolly <\/strong>messenger responded, &ldquo;She said that if you attack Persia, you will destroy a great empire.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The news filled Croesus with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>euphoria<\/strong>. After hearing the Oracle&rsquo;s prophecy, many <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>civilians<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>enrolled <\/strong>in the Lydian army. The king <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>marshaled<\/strong> his troops and prepared them for a war with Persia. Their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>morale <\/strong>was high because they were sure they would win. Soon, King Croesus <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>authorized <\/strong>an attack against the Persians.<\/p><p>However, the Persian army was still very strong. After a few months of fighting, it was obvious that the Oracle&rsquo;s prophecy had come true: by attacking the Persians, King Croesus had destroyed a great empire&mdash;his own! King Croesus should have considered the advice more carefully.<\/p>",

It was covered with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>filth<\/strong>, and most of the furniture was broken. Plus, the kitchen sink leaked water all over the floor. Greta was too old to do <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>housekeeping <\/strong>and repairs herself, so she hired a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>butler <\/strong>named Gordon.<\/p><p>Gordon was a young, muscular man. His muscles were a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>testament <\/strong>to his strong work ethic. He believed that if he worked hard, great things would happen for him. On his first day, he worked for hours cleaning and making repairs. He swept up <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>mounds <\/strong>of dirt. He tightened the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>valve<\/strong> underneath the kitchen <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>faucet <\/strong>to stop the leak. He even bought <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>timber <\/strong>to build new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>stools <\/strong>for the kitchen. He worked so hard that his fingers went <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>numb<\/strong>, and he got <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>cramps <\/strong>in his shoulders.<\/p><p>Gordon worked hard every day. Even when tasks were boring, he was never <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>reckless<\/strong>. He made sure there were no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>flaws <\/strong>in his work. Gordon was worried, however, that Greta wasn&rsquo;t pleased. She never expressed thanks or said that he did a good job. The lack of appreciation <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>evoked<\/strong> unhappy feelings in Gordon. He even thought about quitting. But he decided the right thing to do was to keep working hard.<\/p><p>One day, while Gordon was sweeping, Greta said, &ldquo;Gordon! I have a surprise for you!&rdquo; He went to Greta&rsquo;s room and saw a beautiful <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>slate<\/strong> statue. It looked just like him! It was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>adorned <\/strong>with a banner that read: &ldquo;Welcome home.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Greta said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made this ugly old mansion look new again. I&rsquo;m so thankful for your hard work that I want you to have it. I&rsquo;ll move into a smaller house.&rdquo;<\/p><p>He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>grinned <\/strong>and gave Greta a big hug. He said, &ldquo; I&rsquo;m in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>bliss<\/strong>! My hard work really paid off!&rdquo;<\/p><p>The two said their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>farewells<\/strong>, and Gordon spent the afternoon admiring his beautiful new home.<\/p>",

During the 1800s, more than 20 million people got the disease every year. Of those, nearly half died. At the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>onset <\/strong>of smallpox, people suffered from high fevers, headaches, vomiting, and aching muscles. Yet the worst symptom of all was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>intolerable<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>rash <\/strong>that caused irritation on the entire body. Those who survived the disease were often <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>rendered <\/strong>blind or left with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>gross<\/strong> scars on their face and body.<\/p><p>Today, however, cases of smallpox are very rare due to the work of many countries during the late 1900s. This <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>federation <\/strong>of countries <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>collaborated <\/strong>to completely destroy smallpox. Early in the century, wealthy countries in Europe and North America had developed a substance that made the body immune to smallpox. They had required all their citizens to get this vaccine to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>counteract <\/strong>the disease. Hence, the people of these countries no longer had to worry about smallpox.<\/p><p>However, many of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>needy <\/strong>people in poorer parts of the world still suffered from the disease. Their countries could not afford the vaccine nor supply enough doctors to curb the spread of smallpox.<\/p><p>In 1950, the wealthier countries of the world <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vowed <\/strong>to free the world of the disease. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pledged <\/strong>to supply the vaccine to any country that could not afford it. Scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>compiled <\/strong>lists of areas where the disease still thrived. Then doctors <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>diagnosed <\/strong>people who had the disease in these areas. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>enacted <\/strong>laws that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>prohibited <\/strong>people with smallpox from mixing with those who did not. In this way, they could not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>transmit <\/strong>the disease to others. Then the doctors gave all of them the vaccine.<\/p><p>It took a longtime and a lot of work. But nearly thirty years later, on December 9,1979, a group of scientists <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>certified <\/strong>that smallpox had been successfully stopped. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>humane <\/strong>efforts of people from all over the world had accomplished a great task.<\/p>",

And though he needed courage, he never imagined how he would learn it.<\/p><p>During a march across a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>tract <\/strong>of wilderness near his country&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>frontier<\/strong>, Tom <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>strayed <\/strong>from his squad. He had stopped to gaze at a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>splendid<\/strong> view of a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>lush <\/strong>valley. When he turned around, his squad was gone. He searched for them, but because their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>outfits <\/strong>had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>camouflage<\/strong>, he couldn&rsquo;t find them.<\/p><p>It was getting dark, and Tom grew <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>weary<\/strong>. All he had was a knife, a boomerang, and his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>handbook<\/strong>. He made a camp for the night. It was cold, and the ground was hard. He wished he had his cot and a blanket. Instead, he made a fire, wrapped himself tightly in his jacket, and fell asleep.<\/p><p>A loud noise roused him from his sleep. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he wondered.<\/p><p>Then he noticed it. An animal of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>substantial <\/strong>size had left a print from its <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>paw <\/strong>in the dirt. He sat closer to the fire and looked into the darkness. He imagined a large beast jumping from the gloom and attacking him. He shook so much from fear that it felt like the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>marrow <\/strong>in his bones <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>quivered<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Tom <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>contemplated <\/strong>many different plans. He was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>hesitant <\/strong>to act. He decided to stay by the fire, but during his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>vigil<\/strong>, he heard more noises.<\/p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>contend <\/strong>with his fear any longer. He knew what he had to do. He made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>torch <\/strong>and followed the prints. He heard a twig snap very close ahead, but he bravely went on. Seconds later, he discovered what had scared him. It was only a kangaroo.<\/p><p>Tom went back to his camp and slept. In the morning, he found his squad. He had finally learned courage. He learned that he had to confront his fear in order to conquer it.<\/p>",

A severe health <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>hazard <\/strong>caused the outbreak. There was an extreme lack of clean drinking water in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>overcrowded <\/strong>urban cities. Garbage and chemicals got into the public water supplies and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>contaminated <\/strong>them. Since people did not have access to other sources, they had to drink the dirty water.<\/p><p>The outbreak spread rapidly and infected almost 16,000 people. The illness caused extreme pain in people&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>intestines<\/strong>. It also caused a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>deficiency <\/strong>of important fluids in sick people&rsquo;s bodies. Without the proper fluids and minerals, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>metabolic <\/strong>processes stopped working correctly. People were unable to digest food properly or <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>replenish <\/strong>their lost nutrients. If they had not received <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>viable <\/strong>treatment, they would have been likely to die. It was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>imperative <\/strong>for help to come soon.<\/p><p>However, the government of Zimbabwe was unable to provide help to its people. The government didn&rsquo;t have a plan to stop the spread of cholera. In addition, the country was too poor to get clean water or medication for the sick. The people seemed to be doomed.<\/p><p>Luckily, many other countries recognized the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>paramount <\/strong>need to contain the outbreak. Dozens of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>voluntary<\/strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>practitioners <\/strong>from Britain, France, the United States, and other countries went to Zimbabwe to treat the disease. Through the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>provision <\/strong>of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>sterile <\/strong>drinking water and medication, people finally got the treatment they badly needed. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>compassionate <\/strong>doctors were able to save the lives of thousands. By January of 2009, the epidemic was almost completely contained.<\/p><p>Today, the Zimbabwean government is working with other countries to prevent future epidemics. They are cleaning up the water supply and learning how to avoid health hazards. The system used to filter water is being <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>upgraded<\/strong>. The government now <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>administers <\/strong>the water supply plants and makes sure that they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>adhere <\/strong>to strict safety guidelines. Hopefully, future instances of cholera will be treated before they start deadly epidemics.<\/p>",

The audience and actors <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>evacuated<\/strong> the building. Luckily, no one was hurt, and the fire was soon put out. Immediately, the audience assembled into an angry <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>mob <\/strong>and demanded to know what had happened.<\/p><p>It was soon revealed that the fire had started <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>backstage<\/strong>, and only two people were in the area at the time. One was the husband of the play&rsquo;s star actress, the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>billionaire <\/strong>Henry Rich. The other was the theater&rsquo;s janitor, Bill, a large and strong man who looked like a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>brute<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The crowd <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>segregated <\/strong>the two men and demanded to know who the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>culprit <\/strong>was. Most of the crowd thought that Bill was to blame. They felt that he had started the fire without ever <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>subjecting <\/strong>him to any <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>scrutiny<\/strong>. Bill <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>resented <\/strong>this but said nothing.<\/p><p>Luckily, the billionaire&rsquo;s wife <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>testified <\/strong>in his defense. &ldquo;Your decision is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>premature<\/strong>,&rdquo; she told the crowd. &ldquo; I fell down <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>amid <\/strong>the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>tumult <\/strong>while everyone fled the fire. Bill rescued me and carried me out of the building. I think you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>underestimate <\/strong>his character. Besides, in order to be close enough to save me, he couldn&rsquo;t have been near the place where the fire began.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The crowd then turned their eyes to the billionaire. &ldquo; He did it!&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;Make him pay!&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; the billionaire said over the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>uproar<\/strong>. &ldquo; I admit that I started the fire, but it was an accident. I was going backstage to see my wife and was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>clumsy<\/strong>. I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>collided <\/strong>with a lamp, and it fell to the floor. The floor was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>flammable<\/strong>. A fire started, and I fled.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The mob was surprised. The man they blamed was innocent, and the billionaire was guilty. To pay for his error, the billionaire not only repaired the theater but had it remade to be better than before.<\/p>",

He was attempting to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>duplicate <\/strong>lightning in clouds. He had made a device that could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>simulate <\/strong>lightning. It worked by releasing an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>electromagnetic <\/strong>pulse into the cloud. This pulse, in turn, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>stimulated <\/strong>the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>electrons <\/strong>in the cloud&rsquo;s particles. Then the electrons produced lightning.<\/p><p>But his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>meteorological <\/strong>experiment had a major <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>defect<\/strong>. He couldn&rsquo;t get the device into the sky.<\/p><p>He had tied it to balloons, but they had burst. He had shot the device from a cannon, but the force of the cannon had damaged it.<\/p><p>&ldquo;You should give up,&rdquo; his friends told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get that thing into the air.&rdquo;<\/p><p>But his friends&rsquo; criticisms only <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>spurred <\/strong>him to try again. The student was very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>innovative<\/strong>, and at last, he thought that he had an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>innovation <\/strong>that would work. He attached wings to the device, and on one <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>dreary <\/strong>day, when clouds blocked the light of the sun, he started his experiment <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>anew<\/strong>.<\/p><p>He placed the device on a rocket and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>launched <\/strong>it into the sky. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>propulsion <\/strong>of the rocket carried the device high into the air. The rocket <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accelerated <\/strong>into the clouds and then released the device. It <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>glided <\/strong>on its wings through the clouds, and when it <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>penetrated <\/strong>the center of a large black cloud, it emitted the electromagnetic pulse. And just as he had predicted, lightning shot from the cloud!<\/p><p>He called his professors, and the next day they came to watch. He successfully duplicated the experiment. His teachers were extremely impressed and called the student and his invention <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>ingenious<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The student was given many awards and became a famous inventor. He had not given up. He had remained <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tenacious <\/strong>and succeeded.<\/p>",

The child&rsquo;s mother, who was usually quite <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>vivacious <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>chattered <\/strong>constantly, was quiet and worried. She knew that if she did not act quickly, the child&rsquo;s condition would <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>deteriorate<\/strong>.<\/p><p>She summoned the children&rsquo;s nurse and said to her, &ldquo;The monks make a medicine that can cure my child&rsquo;s sickness. Please, hurry tonight to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>monastery <\/strong>and get it.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The nurse immediately hurried from the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>manor <\/strong>to get the medicine. The monastery was far away by Rabbit <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>Cove<\/strong>, and there was no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>freeway<\/strong> leading to it. The only way there was to walk along a dark and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>winding <\/strong>trail.<\/p><p>The temperature was close to zero degrees <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>centigrade<\/strong>, and it was raining. Luckily, the nurse had grabbed her raincoat <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>beforehand<\/strong>. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>zipped <\/strong>it up and pulled the hood over her head.<\/p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;ll never make it there,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo; Perhaps I should return and go in the morning.&rdquo; But she remembered the sick child and decided to continue.<\/p><p>Finally, she arrived at the monastery. It was very late. She feared the monks would not be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>hospitable<\/strong>. But she approached the door and knocked anyway. The rain had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>condensed <\/strong>on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>exterior <\/strong>of the windows by the door. All she could see was the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>profile <\/strong>of a large man coming to answer the door. Again, she was filled with fear.<\/p><p>But the monk smiled at her when he opened the door. He took her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>outstretched <\/strong>hand and welcomed her with a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>hearty <\/strong>voice. The place was warm, and she heard a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>concerto <\/strong>playing in another room. She relaxed.<\/p><p>&ldquo; How can I help you?&rdquo; the monk asked, and the nurse explained the situation.<\/p><p>He instantly knew what to do.

That&rsquo;s because doctors in the 1800s were influenced more by <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>primal <\/strong>medical beliefs than science.<\/p><p>Rather than thinking the brain caused seizures, people in the 180&#39; still thought they were the result of strange forces. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>equated <\/strong>seizures with the work of evil spirits. Others felt that the seizures had a cosmic or <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>lunar <\/strong>cause. They believed that the cycles of the moon and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>constellations <\/strong>could make someone have a seizure.<\/p><p>During a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>session <\/strong>to treat a patient who had seizures, doctors would force the patient to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>invoke <\/strong>the grace of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>Almighty<\/strong>. They thought if the patient did this, then the patient would rid themselves of the evil spirits causing the seizures.<\/p><p>The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>advent <\/strong>of modern <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>psychiatry <\/strong>occurred during the 1800s. At that time people who suffered from seizures were placed in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>psychiatric<\/strong> hospitals. They were treated like they were insane. However, none of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>outmoded <\/strong>treatments worked.<\/p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the late 1850s that the causes of seizures were understood. We know today that these causes <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>pertain <\/strong>to the brain. Misfired signals from the brain cause a jerking <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>reflex <\/strong>in the body. These usually occur when someone is very tired.<\/p><p>Once the causes of seizures were known, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>definitive <\/strong>treatments were developed. Today, treatments range from taking pills to having surgery. Treatment is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>personalized <\/strong>according to the type of seizure the patient has.<\/p><p>Even today, some people are unsure about seizures. Their most common mistake is thinking that a person having a seizure will swallow their tongue. They often shove some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>utensil <\/strong>in the person&rsquo;s mouth. However, this doesn&rsquo;t help. The utensil often blocks the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>airway <\/strong>and prevents the person from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>inhaling<\/strong>. Yet most of the public no longer fear people who have seizures. Instead, they can now help and comfort a person if they have a seizure.<\/p>",

He understood how they used <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>photosynthesis <\/strong>to make oxygen and which ones produced the best <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pollen<\/strong>. Bees had an important <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>dependency <\/strong>on pollen. From the beginning of time, bees&rsquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>eternal<\/strong> task was to gather pollen and make honey with it.<\/p><p>Since he passed his exams, the little bee had earned his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>inclusion <\/strong>in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>swarms <\/strong>that gathered pollen. He was excited because he was finally allowed to leave the hive. He left with the next swarm and was determined to find the perfect flower. Soon he saw a large, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vibrant <\/strong>flower full of pollen. He landed on a petal and walked toward the pollen at the flower&rsquo;s center.<\/p><p>Immediately, he began rolling in the pollen, gathering it on his legs and wings. The fine <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>texture <\/strong>of the pollen <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tickled <\/strong>when it stuck to his body. It was the best experience the little bee had ever had. He gathered as much as he could.<\/p><p>But when he was flying back home, he realized that all the pollen had an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>adverse <\/strong>effect. He had no control over his flight. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>intermittent <\/strong>wind <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>fluctuated <\/strong>in power. He was blown to and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>fro<\/strong>. One minute he was flying straight, and the next minute the wind had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>reversed <\/strong>his course.<\/p><p>He tried to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>dump <\/strong>some of the pollen, but it acted as an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>adhesive<\/strong>. He couldn&rsquo;t get it off. He became tired and fell to the ground.<\/p><p>&ldquo;What am I going to do now?&rdquo; he thought. Just then, his mentor landed next to him and began cleaning the excess pollen off the little bee. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have taken so much,&rdquo; his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>mentor <\/strong>said.<\/p><p>Finally, with the pollen off of him, the bee easily <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>regained <\/strong>his strength, and like a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>phoenix<\/strong>, the young bee flew back into the air. When he returned to the hive, he turned to his mentor and said, &ldquo; I learned an important lesson today. I will never be greedy again.&rdquo;<\/p>",

Two men <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>aspired <\/strong>to become mayor: Mr. Jones and Mr. Webb. Mr. Jones was a tall, handsome man. He was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>phenomenal <\/strong>speaker, and the citizens loved him. However, Mr. Jones didn&rsquo;t know much about running a city. He was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pathological <\/strong>liar who merely <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>flattered <\/strong>people with his words. Mr. Webb was very different. He was a small, unattractive man. He was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>lame<\/strong> and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>limped <\/strong>when he walked. But he was an expert on politics and knew what was best for the people.<\/p><p>The citizens of Sherman didn&rsquo;t care about what the politicians had to say. No one listened to Mr. Webb, even though he had great ideas. They cheered when Mr. Jones spoke, although he didn&rsquo;t talk about important things. His pretty words put people in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>trance<\/strong>. All the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>polls <\/strong>predicted that Mr. Jones would win the election.<\/p><p>When the votes were totaled, Mr. Jones won easily. But when he took office, he didn&rsquo;t know what to do! He tried to hide his ignorance by working in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>secrecy<\/strong>. He added a law to the city&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>constitution <\/strong>that prevented citizens from seeing the mayor. He even <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>censored <\/strong>newspapers that tried to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>disseminate <\/strong>information about his inability to help the people.<\/p><p>Soon, however, Mr. Jones became <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>infamous <\/strong>for his poor leadership. There was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>outburst <\/strong>of anger among the citizens. They were full of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>remorse <\/strong>for their misguided decision to elect an ignorant mayor. They voted to remove Mr. Jones and let Mr. Webb take over. Immediately, Mr. Webb proved that he was a great mayor. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>abolished <\/strong>Mr. Jones&rsquo;s law, and he was willing to talk openly with everyone. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tackled <\/strong>important issues and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>amended <\/strong>unfair laws in the city&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>charter<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The citizens learned that a pleasant appearance and nice words do not make a good leader. The most important qualities are intelligence and a desire to help others.<\/p>",

He didn&rsquo;t know if he should <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>delete <\/strong>the article he had just written or go ahead and publish it. He was scared and filled with doubt.<\/p><p>The empire had passed a new law stating that citizens could only use the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>imperial <\/strong>language. The editor disagreed with the law and decided to write an article about why it was wrong. He felt that the new law <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>excluded <\/strong>people of different <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>nationalities <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>racial <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>ethnic <\/strong>backgrounds. He had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>firsthand <\/strong>knowledge of what it feels like not to be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>fluent <\/strong>in the imperial language because he was from a remote part of the empire.<\/p><p>He felt that the empire shouldn&rsquo;t be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>monolingual <\/strong>and should be more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>inclusive<\/strong>. Yet he was afraid that he would get in trouble for having this belief. Many would say that he was not a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>patriot<\/strong>&mdash;that he didn&rsquo;t love the empire. But he didn&rsquo;t wish to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>undermine <\/strong>the authority of the empire. He wanted to argue that the empire could be stronger if it accepted people of various cultures and beliefs.<\/p><p>At last, he decided to stop being a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>coward <\/strong>and to be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>earnest <\/strong>about how he felt. He wrote the article. It wasn&rsquo;t rude or angry, but rather, very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>solemn <\/strong>and intelligent. The next day it was published in all the papers.<\/p><p>Everyone was impressed by his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tact <\/strong>and showed <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>solidarity <\/strong>with his ideas. He expected to be arrested any day, but the police never came. Surprisingly, instead of being <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>prosecuted<\/strong>, he became a hero. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>legislature <\/strong>changed the law, and people from many <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>linguistic <\/strong>backgrounds praised him.<\/p><p>&quot;Never be afraid to be vocal,&quot; the editor later wrote. &quot;If you think something is wrong, then stand up for what you believe.&quot;<\/p>",

                    "story": "<p>Last year, Erik constructed one of the world&rsquo;s strangest houses in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>glacial <\/strong>landscape of northern Sweden. He called it the Ice House: a house made entirely of ice and snow. All of the beds, chairs, tables, and walls are cold, hard sculptures of ice.<\/p><p>A group of architects and volunteers from all over the world traveled to the site of the Ice House and began its construction. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>multicultural <\/strong>group journeyed through <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>blizzards <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>frigid <\/strong>temperatures to reach the site. Once the builders arrived, there was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>interchange <\/strong>of ideas, and tools were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>allocated <\/strong>to each worker. An expert was selected to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>oversee <\/strong>the building process to make sure there was no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>discord <\/strong>between the workers. Once a plan was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>generated<\/strong>, they got right to work. The design was very unique; the builders couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>replicate <\/strong>the design from normal houses.<\/p><p>The first step was to build the walls and ceiling. The builders used a metal frame to help them build the structure. After the ice was in place, the frame was removed. The builders then created furniture and art pieces. Designs were carved into each piece. One worker carved big <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wavy <\/strong>lines, and another made tiny <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>clockwise<\/strong>, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>concentric <\/strong>circles. Finally, the workers carved small <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>cavities <\/strong>in the roof and inserted colored lights. When the work was finished, the beautiful house was ready for a resident to enjoy.<\/p><p>Living in the Ice House is an experience like no other. Erik stores his belongings in an ice <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>locker <\/strong>and lays out a sleeping bag on his ice bed. At dinner, he dines on a delicious salad with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>crisp <\/strong>toppings. And for the main course, he enjoys <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>appetizing <\/strong>fish caught from a nearby river. The fish are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>pierced <\/strong>with icicles and served on ice plates. After dinner, he gets ready for a cold night. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>omission <\/strong>of heaters can be too much for his visitors sometimes. Luckily, there are warm rooms nearby, as a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>courtesy <\/strong>to people who get too cold.<\/p>",

Too many people are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>crammed <\/strong>into cities and towns around the globe. Earth&rsquo;s population is about 6.5 billion people. This number is growing every day. In just 50 years, the population will be almost 9 billion.<\/p><p>Many people worry that the Earth won&rsquo;t have enough resources to support so many people. One major reason for this is that wasting resources and polluting have become <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>habitual <\/strong>behaviors. Industrial <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>output <\/strong>results in polluting the air with dangerous <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>fumes<\/strong>. Also, cars and machines waste a ton of important natural resources like oil and water. It&rsquo;s possible that the Earth may become so damaged that it cannot support a large population of humans.<\/p><p>Another issue is the lack of useful land for cultivating crops. Even today, many people <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>subsist <\/strong>on mere <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>scraps <\/strong>of food and little water. In 50 years, many experts worry that huge numbers of people will starve to death. So what is being done to prepare for the future?<\/p><p>People are realizing they can no longer <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>justify <\/strong>their wasteful behavior or <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>defer <\/strong>action to fix it. Many car companies already have <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>patents <\/strong>on <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>prototypes <\/strong>for very efficient cars. Such cars waste no resources and produce no pollution. A <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>conversion <\/strong>to clean cars means that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>petroleum <\/strong>can be saved for the future. In addition, the environmental <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sectors <\/strong>of many governments are setting strict rules for industries that pollute too much. If companies do not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>abide <\/strong>by the standards, they are <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>penalized <\/strong>with higher taxes. In some cases, their operations might be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>suspended <\/strong>altogether.<\/p><p>Food is also an issue that is being tackled. Many countries are now <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>subscribing <\/strong>to the point of view that immediate action is needed. They are determining ways to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>export <\/strong>goods to people in need, so that no one goes hungry. Experts will continue to come up with ideas for the future, and a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>synthesis <\/strong>of these ideas will help to support the growing population.<\/p>",

Even though they were very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>industrious<\/strong>, the weather became too cold outside to plant their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>staple <\/strong>food, rice. So what did they do? Since they had so much free time during the long, cold winters, the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>inventive <\/strong>farmers started performing tricks to entertain themselves. They used their farm tools and anything they could find to make their tricks more spectacular. They even twisted their bodies into crazy shapes and performed awesome jumps. Overtime, they became great <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acrobats<\/strong>, and their art form came to be known as &ldquo; Hundred Plays.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Hundred Plays involves doing many kinds of tricks. For example, in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>Mandarin<\/strong>-speaking parts of China, performers do the lion dance. They wear costumes and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>mimic <\/strong>the animal&rsquo;s movements. Early performers also did tricks on ropes and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vines <\/strong>that were high above the ground.<\/p><p>Even though the acrobats&rsquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>fluid <\/strong>movements may have looked easy, they took a lot of work.<\/p><p>Learning Hundred Plays is a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>communal <\/strong>event. A <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>veteran <\/strong>of the acrobatic arts usually teaches younger people in the village. They spend a lot of time <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>rehearsing<\/strong>. The young performers also learn an old philosophy. The teachings help them <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>harmonize <\/strong>the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sensory <\/strong>aspects of acrobatics with mental aspects. In other words, it teaches them to use their physical and mental strength together.<\/p><p>Since the art has its origins with poor farmers, rich people used to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>scorn <\/strong>acrobats. They thought acrobats were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>villains<\/strong>. The rich people thought the acrobats just wanted to trick them. But later, their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>misguided <\/strong>opinions changed. Acrobats came to be respected in Chinese society.

The kids at school would play tricks on her all the time. They would hide behind the door of the school <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>janitor<\/strong>&rsquo;s closet, then jump out to scare her. Once, a boy dressed up like a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>vampire <\/strong>and chased her down the street. Anne hated being <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>constrained <\/strong>by her fears, but she didn&rsquo;t know how to be brave.<\/p><p>She was walking home from school one day when someone came up behind her. Before she could turn around, a powerful man grabbed her. She couldn&rsquo;t scream because a huge hand was put over her mouth. Anne knew that this could not be another <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>stunt <\/strong>by her classmates. The scary man <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>restrained <\/strong>her arms and legs and carried her to his house. He tied Anne to a chair. Her <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>guts <\/strong>began to hurt because she was so scared.<\/p><p>The man <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>prodded <\/strong>Anne with his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>forefinger <\/strong>and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay right here until I get a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>ransom <\/strong>from your parents. Then I&rsquo;ll be rich!&rdquo; The dirty man <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>spit <\/strong>when he talked. A string of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>saliva <\/strong>hung from his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>moist <\/strong>lips. Anne was terrified and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>intimidated <\/strong>by the horrible man. But she knew she had to escape somehow.<\/p><p>Eventually, the man <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>yawned<\/strong>. Anne waited quietly until he fell asleep. As he slept, she carefully wiggled her arms and legs until the ropes became loose. She slipped out of the ropes and carefully opened the door. She <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sprinted <\/strong>to the bus <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>depot <\/strong>and boarded a bus to the police station. She told the police what happened, and they arrested the kidnapper.<\/p><p>The kids at school were amazed. They asked her, &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you too scared to escape?&rdquo;<\/p><p>She said, &ldquo;<strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>Nope<\/strong>, I knew that I had to be brave and get out of there!&rdquo;<\/p><p>The kids were very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>tolerant <\/strong>of Anne from then on.

Michael was once an expert <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>archer <\/strong>and a great fighter. In fact, his skills seemed to be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>hereditary<\/strong>; all the people in his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>ancestry <\/strong>were famous warriors. However, he was getting old and no longer wished to fight.<\/p><p>One day, he was in the forest hunting <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>prey <\/strong>when he saw a beautiful <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>prophet <\/strong>singing a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>hymn<\/strong>.

You&rsquo;re the only one who can defeat them and stop the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>tyranny<\/strong>.

I will even make a potion to increase your strength.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The prophet took out a bottle and a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>funnel<\/strong>. She poured some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vinegar <\/strong>and garlic into the bottle. Next, she added some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>seasoning <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>sodium<\/strong> and shook it up.<\/p><p>Michael smelled the potion. &ldquo;Wow, this is <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>fragrant<\/strong>,&rdquo; he said in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sarcastic <\/strong>tone. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>inverted <\/strong>the bottle and drank the whole potion. He immediately felt stronger. &ldquo; I&rsquo;ll try my best,&rdquo; he promised.<\/p><p>Michael rode his horse to a hilltop, where he could see the village of Hampton below. He saw the evil <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tyrant <\/strong>and his men marching in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>procession <\/strong>through the town.<\/p><p>Michael charged down the hill and into the village. An enemy <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>deputy <\/strong>officer shouted, &ldquo; He looks as strong as an ox!&rdquo; It was an apt <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>analogy<\/strong>. Michael grabbed the officer and threw him across the street with one arm. The rest of the officers screamed and rode away, and their army followed.<\/p><p>The prophet reappeared. Michael said, &ldquo; It&rsquo;s a good thing you gave me the potion.&rdquo;<\/p><p>She replied, &ldquo; But Michael, the potion was fake! Your strength really came from having confidence!<\/p><p>Michael realized he really was still great. He just needed to believe in himself.<\/p>",

Around the mansion, he then <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>erected <\/strong>a great wall. He built an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>arch <\/strong>for the gate out of huge <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>slabs<\/strong> of stone. The lord was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>overjoyed <\/strong>with the addition to his home.<\/p><p>However, one day while he was sitting on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>terrace<\/strong>, some farmers knocked at his door. He invited them in. Despite his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>hospitality<\/strong>, the farmers appeared to be in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>foul <\/strong>mood.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Why are you so upset?&rdquo; the lord asked.<\/p><p>One farmer replied, &ldquo;That is actually the reason for our visit.&rdquo; He then handed the lord a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>petition<\/strong>.

They left, but they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>assembled <\/strong>that night outside the mansion&rsquo;s gate. They planned to destroy the mansion. The lord&rsquo;s servants tried to defend the house, but the farmers <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>outnumbered <\/strong>them.<\/p><p>The servants fled, and the farmers rushed into the mansion and set it on fire. Everyone got out of the house, and there were no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>casualties<\/strong>. However, the fire soon spread from the house to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>adjoining <\/strong>pastures that belonged to the farmers.<\/p><p>Both sides&rsquo; properties were destroyed. The lord and the farmers were sorry for their actions. The lord promised to pay for the burned pastures, and the farmers promised to rebuild the mansion.

His load was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>comprised <\/strong>of many types of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>ore<\/strong>. He needed a huge truck to carry its <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bulk <\/strong>to a ship waiting at a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>pier <\/strong>on the country&rsquo;s eastern coast. At the border between two counties, he&rsquo;d have to pay a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>tariff <\/strong>on the cargo. However, he could keep his money if he avoided the station at the border. He worried about getting in trouble for not paying the tariff, but the thought of extra money <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>outweighed <\/strong>this concern.<\/p><p>He took out his road map. To his surprise, it <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>depicted <\/strong>a small road that had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dual <\/strong>advantage. It not only avoided the border station but also was a shorter route to the coast. He decided to take the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>shortcut<\/strong>.<\/p><p>However, along his journey, he soon ran into problems. First, he had to cross a small wooden bridge. His truck weighed too much for the bridge. It was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>analogous <\/strong>to an elephant trying to stand on a tree branch. The bridge started to break as the truck crossed, and the trailer <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>tilted <\/strong>to the right. Fortunately, the truck made it safely across, but most of the ore fell into the river below.<\/p><p>Next, it was a very hot day. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>thermometer <\/strong>read over 100 degrees <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>Fahrenheit<\/strong>. The truck&rsquo;s engine became too hot, so the driver parked it in the shade of a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>grove <\/strong>of trees until it cooled down.<\/p><p>Later, he took a wrong turn. He stopped and took out his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>binoculars<\/strong>. He scanned his surroundings and eventually discovered a landmark that led him back to the proper route.<\/p><p>Finally, he arrived at the pier, but the ship wasn&rsquo;t there. When he asked about the ship&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>whereabouts<\/strong>, a man said that it had left thirty minutes ago. He had not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>fulfilled <\/strong>his duty. He realized then the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>paradox <\/strong>of the shortcut. The shortest route can be the longest, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>vice versa<\/strong>, a long route may be the fastest.<\/p>",

They looked past the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>gravel <\/strong>road that led to a natural <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>reservoir <\/strong>on the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>delta<\/strong>. On the other side of the water, there was a cottage.<\/p><p>&ldquo; Does a ghost live there?&rdquo; Lucas asked.<\/p><p>&ldquo; No, a mad hatter lives there,&rdquo; said his grandfather. Lucas didn&rsquo;t know what a mad hatter was, but the image of a scary man <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>haunted <\/strong>him.<\/p><p>Later, Lucas went for a walk in the forest. He collected pieces of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>amber <\/strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>granite <\/strong>that he found on the ground. He looked at the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>moss <\/strong>on the trees and watched a bird <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>peck <\/strong>at the ground. But the forest was like a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>maze<\/strong>. Soon, Lucas was lost.<\/p><p>Lucas heard somebody behind him. He wanted to run away, but he fell. He had a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>streak <\/strong>of blood on his shirt and some <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>pebbles <\/strong>stuck in his skin. Then a man appeared.<\/p><p>&ldquo; I will take you home. First, let&rsquo;s get you cleaned up,&rdquo; he said.<\/p><p>Lucas followed him. When they arrived at the cottage, he realized the man was the mad hatter!<\/p><p>He sat down inside. It smelled like <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>charcoal<\/strong>, but it looked like a normal house. The man brought Lucas back some medicine.<\/p><p>&ldquo; It&rsquo;s a bit old, but it&rsquo;s not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>expired<\/strong>,&rdquo; the man said.<\/p><p>While Lucas cleaned his cut, the man washed the blood out of his shirt with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>detergent<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Lucas asked, &ldquo;Are you a mad hatter?&rdquo;<\/p><p>The man laughed and replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>euphemism <\/strong>for a crazy person. Actually, I&rsquo;m pretty normal. I&rsquo;m a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>columnist <\/strong>fora newspaper,&rdquo; said the man. He pointed to his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>credentials <\/strong>which hung on the wall.<\/p><p>Lucas could hear the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>crickets <\/strong>outside. It was getting dark, so he asked, &ldquo;Could you take me home now?&rdquo;<\/p><p>The man said yes. Lucas was surprised that people thought the man was crazy. He was actually very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>courteous<\/strong>. Maybe Lucas should have a more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>liberal <\/strong>attitude. Next time, Lucas wouldn&rsquo;t make judgments about people without getting to know them first.<\/p>",

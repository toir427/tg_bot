St. Nicholas was a real person.</p><p>A long time ago, a man named Marcus <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>occupied</strong> a house with his family. He was not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>modest</strong>. He always told everybody he was the strongest man in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>province</strong>.</p><p>He worked hard, but he could barely <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>sustain</strong> his family. He wanted to save money and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>prosper</strong>. Still, he could never earn a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>penny</strong> more than he needed.</p><p>One day, Marcus made an agreement with a blacksmith. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>blacksmith</strong> had a lot of work to do. But he couldn&rsquo;t do it all by himself. Marcus wanted to help him <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>forge</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>iron</strong>. The blacksmith agreed to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>compensate</strong> him with a lot of money.</p><p>In the same town, there was a man named Nicholas. At an early age, Nicholas started <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>preaching</strong>. But he also believed that he should be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>humble</strong> and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>charitable</strong>. He learned that helping people gave him even more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>satisfaction</strong> than preaching.</p><p>One day, Nicholas <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>encountered</strong> Marcus. Marcus told Nicholas about his agreement with the blacksmith. &ldquo; I worked hard for him,&rdquo; Marcus said, &ldquo; but a problem <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>arose</strong>. Even though I worked for him, he didn&rsquo;t pay me.&rdquo;</p><p>Nicholas wanted to help Marcus. That night, he went back to Marcus&rsquo;s house. He brought a bag of gold. It <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>exceeded</strong> the amount that Marcus needed. Nicholas climbed up a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>ladder</strong> and dropped the bag of gold down the chimney. Marcus thanked his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>benefactor</strong>.</p><p>Soon, people found out about Nicholas&rsquo;s gift. He became well known and loved. Even today, people still give secret gifts to children. And we say they are from St. Nicholas.</p>",

He thought the extra wheat would <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>discourage</strong> them from leaving.</p><p>It snowed for several days. During that time, the shepherd&rsquo;s sheep ate very little.

He found a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bunch</strong> of wood boards next to a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>pine</strong> tree.

If I let Joe use it, he will be nicer to me and Jane.&rdquo; He took the wood home.</p><p>Mike got an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>ax</strong> and cut the wood.

They thought the food <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>nourished</strong> them on their journey from <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>cemeteries</strong> to heaven. People had to put out good things for souls to eat. However, if the food rotted or <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>spoiled</strong>, the soul got mad. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wicked</strong> soul might <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>curse</strong> the family and make them <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>starve</strong> during the winter.</p><p>In other places, people begged for food on a holiday that remembers the souls of dead saints. People wore <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>disguises</strong> with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>hoods</strong> that covered their faces. If they did not get food, they played a trick on the home. For this reason, the activity is known as &ldquo;trick-or- treating.&rdquo; <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>Shortly</strong> after people first began trick-or-treating, parents started sending their children to beg on that day. Housewives gave the children food if they performed a song or a dance. When people moved to America from all over the world, they brought this tradition with them. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>Inhabitants</strong> of villages started trick-or-treating in the early 1900s. In 1939 a children&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>publication</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acquainted</strong> the whole country with the tradition. It became very popular.</p><p>Today, trick-or-treaters are not begging for food, and they are not <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>scared</strong> of souls. They just enjoy the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>thrill</strong> of dressing up like creatures and getting candy. Ghosts and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>skeletons</strong> are favorite costumes. But some children wear <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>fancy</strong> disguises, like <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>pirates</strong>. They carry <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>flashlights</strong> instead of fires. In some places, children still perform songs or <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>riddles</strong> to get candy. But most of the time, they just say &ldquo;Trick-or-Treat!&rdquo;</p>",

The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>mayor </strong>said Patsy Ann should be called the town&rsquo;s greeter*.</p><p>The people in town loved Patsy Ann, too, even though she lived on the streets. They were willing to fight to keep her. A new law made all dogs wear a collar and get shots. The mayor received many <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>complaints</strong>. People wanted Patsy Ann to be able to stay. One <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>ambitious </strong>sailor got people to help. Together, they paid for Patsy Ann to go to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>veterinarian</strong>. She got her shots and collar. She could stay.</p><p>When Patsy Ann died, everyone missed the town&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>loyal </strong>greeter. So the mayor hired someone to make a statue of Patsy Ann. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>restored </strong>the town&rsquo;s greeter. Now, she sits at the dock forever, waiting for ships to come home.</p><p><em>*greeter - a person whose job is to say hello to new people.</em></p>",

She put Grace in the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>wagon</strong>, but there was nowhere for them to go. So they went back inside.</p><p>Anna put the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>infant </strong>on the floor and went into her room. But when she came back, Grace had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>vanished</strong>! Anna looked everywhere, but she could not find her sister. Maybe the baby had been <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>kidnapped</strong>! &ldquo; Where are you?&rdquo; Anna called <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>aloud</strong>.</p><p>The situation was becoming <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>urgent</strong>. She wanted to call her mom, but she didn&rsquo;t want her to think Anna couldn&rsquo;t do the job. Anna sat down. What was she going to do?</p><p>But then, Anna heard something. It was coming from her room. &ldquo; Grace?&rdquo; She got down on her knees and looked under the bed. She could see Grace&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bald </strong>head. Grace had followed Anna into her room and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>crept </strong>under the bed.</p><p>&ldquo; What a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>relief</strong>!&rdquo; Anna cried.</p><p>She picked up her sister and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>patted </strong>her on the head. Her head was soft and had no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wrinkles</strong>. Grace was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>sucking </strong>on her thumb and looked tired. So, Anna wrapped her in a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>blanket </strong>and sang <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>rhymes </strong>for her. Then she put Grace in bed for a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>nap</strong>.</p><p>After that afternoon, Anna knew that taking care of Grace was not an easy job. It takes a lot of work to take care of a baby!</p>",

He usually carried a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>compass </strong>with him when he went into the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wilderness</strong>, but that day he left it at home.</p><p>As he walked, the forest began to look different. He didn&rsquo;t see any <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>bamboo</strong>. Instead, there were bushes with long <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>leaves</strong>. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>ecosystem </strong>was now very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>abnormal</strong>. Peter knew he was in the Magic <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>Marsh</strong>.</p><p>Now he was tired and thirsty. He was afraid. Being lost in the marsh could be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>fatal</strong>. When people entered it, they never came out.</p><p>At last, he found a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>pond</strong>. Flowers grew around it. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>blossoms </strong>smelled like the best <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>perfume</strong>. He felt relaxed so he drank some water and fell asleep. When he awoke, he saw an evil <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>dwarf </strong>staring at him.</p><p>&ldquo; What are you doing here?&rdquo; it asked. The dwarf spoke in a strange <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dialect</strong>.</p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;m lost,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo; Can you help me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; it said, but Peter didn&rsquo;t know it was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dishonest</strong>.</p><p>The dwarf took an old <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>manuscript </strong>from his pocket. It was a magic map. &ldquo; Just <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>recite </strong>the words at the bottom,&rdquo; the dwarf explained. &ldquo; It will show you how to get home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; Good,&rdquo; Peter said. He was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>impatient </strong>and quickly grabbed the map.</p><p>He recited the magic words, and a line appeared on the map. He walked for many days but never left the marsh. Finally, the map led him back to the pond. He walked in a circle!</p><p>The dwarf was still there. &ldquo; Here&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>proverb </strong>for you to think about,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo; When patience is lost, the so are you.&rdquo;</p>",

When he reached the sidewalk, he caught the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>scent </strong>of ice cream cones and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>anticipated</strong> eating some ice cream.</p><p>Sam opened the door. Uncle John had a new, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>steel </strong>machine. &ldquo; What is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; It&rsquo;s a cone maker. I built it from a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>kit</strong>. You take flour from the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>barrel </strong>and put it in this pan,&rdquo; Uncle John said. &ldquo; Then add water and sugar here and stir it so the sugar <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>dissolves</strong>. Next, you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>fasten </strong>down the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>beam</strong>.&rdquo; Uncle John wanted to look <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>casual</strong>, but he was excited. He made a few <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>swift </strong>motions and turned it on. There was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>puff </strong>of smoke, and then cones came out the other end.</p><p>&ldquo; Is it hard to use? Sam asked.</p><p>&ldquo; On the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>contrary</strong>. It&rsquo;s easy to use. Want to try?&rdquo;</p><p>Sam washed his hands with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>caution</strong>. He made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>deliberate </strong>attempt to keep <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>germs </strong>out of the dough. Soon, Sam had his first cone. He smiled in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>triumph</strong>!</p><p>Uncle John tried to turn the machine off, but it just kept making cones. Sam and Uncle John put them on the counter, then on chairs. Before long, cones <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>scattered </strong>all over the floor.</p><p>They tried everything to stop it, but it wouldn&rsquo;t stop! &ldquo; What are we going to do?&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo; Kick it!&rdquo; yelled Sam. Uncle John lifted his foot and gave the machine a kick. It made a funny noise and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>exploded</strong>. They were both covered with dough*. Uncle John laughed when he knew Sam was OK. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tossed </strong>Sam a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>rag </strong>to clean his face and smiled. &ldquo; I guess we have enough cones now!&rdquo;</p>",

He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>worshipped </strong>money. Dan was a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>millionaire</strong>, but he paid his police officers almost nothing. The police were very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>bitter</strong>, but Dan didn&rsquo;t care. He only cared about his money.</p><p>Every person who <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>inhabited </strong>Oceantown disliked him. Dan <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>enforced </strong>cruel laws. Once, Dan even put his own brother in jail for throwing a coin into a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>fountain</strong>! Sometimes he pointed his gun into the air and pulled the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>trigger</strong>. He didn&rsquo;t want the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bullets </strong>to hit anyone. He just wanted to scare people with the loud sound.</p><p>Finally, the people of Oceantown decided that they had to get rid of Sheriff Dan. With their understanding, the crowd sought to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>unify </strong>the town. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>marched </strong>to Dan&rsquo;s house. He was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>startled </strong>by the sight when he ran to the door. When he opened the door, the crowd jumped on him. They used a rope to tie him to a chair. Dan yelled, &ldquo; Get your hands off of me! I&rsquo;ll put you all in jail for the rest of your lives!&rdquo;</p><p>The crowd didn&rsquo;t listen. They carried Dan to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>harbor </strong>and put him <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>aboard </strong>a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>vessel</strong>. Dan was so scared that he began to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sweat</strong>. He begged, &ldquo; If you let me go, I will give you all my money!&rdquo;</p><p>The crowd said back, &ldquo; Sheriff, we don&rsquo;t care about your money. We know you will never change. We&rsquo;re sending you on a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>voyage </strong>to the middle of the ocean.&rdquo; The boat <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>drifted </strong>out of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>port</strong>, and Dan was never seen again.

Since there was now plenty of food, the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>pharaoh </strong>decided to have a party. The party was a happy <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>affair</strong>. For five days they had a huge feast.</p><p>Monkey was very happy. Because of the famine, he was very <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>slim</strong>. He wanted to eat a lot of food.</p><p>When he arrived at the feast, hundreds of long tables were filled with food. There were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>nuts</strong>, bowls of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>cereal</strong>, and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>ripe </strong>fruit.

However, during the feast, Monkey thought of a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>scheme </strong>to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>exploit </strong>the pharaoh&rsquo;s kindness. He decided to steal some of the food and then eat it at home.</p><p>All the animals were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>cheerful</strong>. They didn&rsquo;t notice that monkey was hiding food. After the feast, Monkey took the food to his house and ate it. He repeated this <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>routine </strong>every day for four days.</p><p>But on the fifth day, the pharaoh had a surprise. He was going to give all the animals a home. Monkey was very excited. But when he arrived at the pharaoh&rsquo;s home, he could not get through the door. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>diameter </strong>of his waist was wider than the doorway. He was too fat!</p><p>Monkey asked the pharaoh to forgive him for his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>theft</strong>. But the pharaoh said no. &ldquo;<strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>Pardon</strong>?&rdquo; asked the monkey. He didn&rsquo;t understand why the pharaoh was being unkind.</p><p>&ldquo; Everybody else will have a home now, but not you.

People said the cup was in a volcano located far away. Anyone who <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>retrieved </strong>the cup would have their wish come true. John and Paul both wanted to find it. Then they could become the leader.</p><p>They both left to find the cup. Before their trip, their mother said they should work together. They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dismissed </strong>that idea. Even though their trips <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>originated </strong>from the same house, each wanted to travel alone.</p><p>They were both <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>miserable </strong>during the trip. They had to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>navigate </strong>small boats across <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>shallow </strong>rivers and climb difficult <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>slopes</strong>. Their journey <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>spanned </strong>many days. When they finally got close to the volcano, the ground began to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>vibrate </strong>and the volcano <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>erupted</strong>. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>Ash </strong>filled the sky and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>lava</strong> covered everything. John climbed to the top of a hill to keep from getting burned. A few moments later, his brother went up the same hill. They were <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>confined </strong>to the hill until the lava cooled down.</p><p>They talked about the things they had seen while <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wandering </strong>around the country. They felt more <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>sympathy </strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>affection </strong>for each other than ever before. They decided that <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>fate </strong>had brought them together.</p><p>The next day they left to finish the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>remainder </strong>of the trip together. Everything seemed much easier. When they finally found the cup, they learned that it didn&rsquo;t make wishes come true. It was only an ordinary cup. But the trip to reach the cup taught them to work together and love each other.</p>",

However, they were afraid of an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>invasion </strong>from a lot of <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>troops</strong>. They didn&rsquo;t have enough <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>warriors </strong>to stop them, so they asked a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>knight </strong>for help.</p><p>The knight made a plan. A tall mountain was outside the town. The road near the top was very narrow. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>Cliffs </strong>rose on both sides of it.</p><p>&ldquo; We must trick the enemy. They have to follow us up the mountain,&rdquo; the knight explained. &ldquo; On the narrow path, only a few can attack us at one time.&rdquo;</p><p>The people agreed with the knight&rsquo;s plan.</p><p>The knight put on his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>armor</strong>, and the warriors got their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>spears</strong>. When the enemy attacked, the knight and warriors acted as if they were afraid. They quickly <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>withdrew </strong>toward the mountain.</p><p>The enemy troops followed them up the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>steep </strong>path. Soon, the enemy became tired.</p><p>At the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>summit</strong>, the knight and his troops stopped. The enemy was close behind them. But now they were tired. Also, only a few could attack because the path was narrow. The knight and the warriors fought the enemy. But there were too many troops.</p><p>The knight was afraid. If the warriors <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>yielded </strong>the path to the enemy, the town would be lost.</p><p>A storm suddenly came over the mountain. There was strong wind and rain. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>Thunder</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>boomed</strong>. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>Lightning </strong>struck some trees near the enemy. The trees <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>blazed</strong>. The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>flames </strong>scared the enemy and they <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>retreated</strong>. They ran down the mountain, out of the town, and never returned.</p><p>The knight explained, &ldquo; With a little luck, a good plan beats even a big army.&rdquo;</p>",

Then an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>orphan </strong>came to his cart.</p><p>&ldquo; Can you <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>spare </strong>a pear?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>Jack felt <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>rage</strong>. He replied, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any money!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; Please, I haven&rsquo;t had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>supper </strong>in days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; No!&rdquo; shouted the farmer.</p><p>The orphan <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sighed</strong>. However, a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>pregnant </strong>lady heard the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>dispute </strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>confronted </strong>Jack. &ldquo; Just give her a pear,&rdquo; she said. Jack had no <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>shame</strong> and said no. Finally, a man bought a pear for the girl.</p><p>The girl quickly ate it, but she saved the seed. She wanted to get <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>revenge</strong>.</p><p>She told Jack, &ldquo; I know a way to get hundreds of pears in one day. I&rsquo;ll show you how.&rdquo;</p><p>He watched the girl dig a hole. She dropped the seed into the ground. Then she spread the dirt over it.</p><p>&ldquo; Watch closely,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo; In a few minutes, a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>stem </strong>will grow. It&rsquo;ll turn into a tree that&rsquo;s full of pears!&rdquo;</p><p>Jack stared at the dirt, but nothing happened.

He looked for the girl, but she had <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>snuck </strong>away.</p><p>Then he looked at his cart in <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>horror</strong>. It was empty! He suddenly realized that the orphan had tricked him. While Jack was waiting for the tree to grow, the people had taken the pears from his cart. They all laughed while they were eating the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tender </strong>fruit. The farmer felt ashamed.

Suddenly, the light became <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dim</strong>. It was going to rain. So he found a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>hollow </strong>tree to sit under. It <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>leaked </strong>a little, but there was no other place he could wait.</p><p>When the rain stopped, his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>joints </strong>felt <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>stiff </strong>from sitting. Suddenly, he heard a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tune </strong>coming from far away. Many <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>fables </strong>said monsters lived in the forest. No one could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>affirm </strong>that the stories were true, though. Still, his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>instincts </strong>told him that there was something out there. He walked farther into the forest.

When he was finished, the leader said, &ldquo; I want you to dance every night.

The <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>circus </strong>was coming to the town.

The circus couldn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>accommodate </strong>all the people who wanted to see the show, but Ben had a ticket.</p><p>Ben <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>peered </strong>at the activity around him. He watched people of both <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>genders </strong>dance all around. They wore funny costumes, and their hair was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>dyed</strong> many different colors. Also, <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tame </strong>tigers with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>stripes </strong>on their fur did tricks.

They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>posed </strong>in front of a funny picture while an artist quickly drew them. Ben couldn&rsquo;t believe it. He was happier than he had ever been before.</p><p>That day, Ben knew what he wanted to do.

Then his friends Lester and Harry showed him a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>poster</strong>.</p><p>&ldquo; It&rsquo;s for a parade in Bremen. We&rsquo;ll go with you, and we can perform our <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>symphony </strong>there,&rdquo; Lester said.</p><p>The animals put together a small <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>bundle </strong>that held a drum, a flute and a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>portable </strong>microphone. Then they took their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>baggage </strong>and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>initiated </strong>their long journey.</p><p>They walked down a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>paved</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>lane </strong>all day. That night, they looked in the window of a house. They saw a group of thieves. They were eating a large dinner and telling stories about their <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>greed </strong>and the people they stole from.</p><p>Lester was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>optimist</strong>. He said, &ldquo; I think we can scare them away!&rdquo;</p><p>Soon, the animals came up with a plan. Harry flew inside and knocked over the lamp. &ldquo; What was that?&rdquo; screamed a thief as the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>bulb </strong>broke. They could barely see now.</p><p>Then Larry stood on two feet, and Lester flew to the top of his head. They looked very big. All three of the animals made scary noises. The thieves tried to hit the animals. But Harry flew over them and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>scratched </strong>them.</p><p>&ldquo; It&rsquo;s a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>phantom</strong>!&rdquo; yelled one thief.</p><p>The thieves ran away. The animals ate and rested. The next morning, Larry said, &ldquo;Why go to Bremen? We can stay here and make music!&rdquo; And so they remained there and were quite happy.</p>",

As a result, it&rsquo;s covered with snow, ice and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>frost</strong>. Then how was the name <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>derived</strong>? It started with a Viking named Erik the Red. Erik had many <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>merits</strong>. However, there was an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>underlying</strong> problem . . . he got angry easily. People were scared of him. However, he was married to the niece of a very powerful man. So everybody tried to be nice to him.</p><p>One day, Erik fought with his neighbor and killed him. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>consequent </strong>punishment was to leave Iceland.</p><p>Many stories <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>circulated </strong>about a land west of Iceland. But only a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>fraction </strong>of the people in Iceland believed them. Still, Erik wanted to find it.</p><p>Erik sailed toward the land <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>via </strong>the Atlantic Ocean. His <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>marine </strong>knowledge was good, but the trip was hard. Some of his men <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>drowned</strong>. Erik&rsquo;s <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>lieutenant </strong>wanted to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>resign </strong>from his position. Others thought about committing <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>suicide</strong>.</p><p>Suddenly, Erik thought he saw something. &ldquo; I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Erik. &ldquo; It must be an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>illusion</strong>.&rdquo; But it was no trick&mdash;it was the new land!</p><p>Erik <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>trembled </strong>in the cold <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>polar </strong>air. He saw that there was ice everywhere. He realized that the ice could keep enemies out. Not even the best <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>navy </strong>could <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>invade </strong>the new land. He could start a new <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dynasty </strong>in his name. But how could he convince people to live here?</p><p>&ldquo; I&rsquo;ll call it &lsquo;Greenland,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. Erik&rsquo;s plan worked Within two years, over a thousand people moved to Greenland. In the end, Greenland got its name all because of a trick.</p>",

They <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>blended</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>flour</strong> and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>ginger </strong>and made a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>disgusting</strong> <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>paste</strong>. Then they tried to wash it down the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>drain</strong>, but it got all over the floor. Later, my brothers said that I did it and I had to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>wipe </strong>it up.</p><p>I worried that my parents liked them more than me. One <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>autumn </strong>day, I was sure I would make my parents proud. I bought a model rocket. After I put it together, I invited everybody to watch it. I wanted my brothers to <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>envy </strong>my technical knowledge. I lit the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>fuse</strong>, but nothing happened.</p><p>&ldquo; Looks like your <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>fireworks </strong>don&rsquo;t work. I hope you kept the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>receipt </strong>so you can return them,&rdquo; my brother said.</p><p>&ldquo; It&rsquo;s not fireworks!&rdquo; I screamed. They were making fun of me again.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t know what went wrong. I hadn&rsquo;t <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>altered </strong>anything. I quickly moved the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>wires </strong>on the bottom, hoping that would help. Suddenly, the rocket flew up. We stood <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>aside </strong>as it <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>curved </strong>through the lawn and ran straight into the mailbox. Then the mailbox <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>collapsed</strong>. The rocket was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>crushed</strong>.</p><p>Embarrassed, I ran inside and hid. A few minutes later, my mom asked, &ldquo; Are you OK?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; I just wanted them to be <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>jealous </strong>of me for once. Now I see why you and Dad don&rsquo;t love me as much as them,&rdquo; I said.</p><p>&ldquo; That&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; said my mom. &ldquo; See my fingers . . . each one is different. You kids are like my fingers: all are different, but I love them all the same.&rdquo;</p><p>I <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>embraced </strong>her. Now I know that my parents love me just as much as my brothers.</p>",

It got there when the Spanish <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>conquered </strong>parts of South America. The Spanish <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>noble</strong>, Francisco Pizarro, arrived in Peru in the 1500s. He found a group of people called the Incas. The Incas believed that their leader, Atahualpa, was both a king and a god. But Pizarro didn&rsquo;t agree.</p><p>&ldquo; It is a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>sin </strong>for a man to think he is God!&rdquo; he said to Atahualpa.</p><p>Atahualpa thought Pizarro was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>insulting </strong>his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>heritage</strong>. He thought the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>blonde </strong>Spanish men held <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>prejudices </strong>against the Incas. But Atahualpa was a kind man and didn&rsquo;t want to fight the Spaniards. He said, &ldquo; If I give you a room full of gold, will you leave my country in peace?&rdquo;</p><p>Pizarro was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='17'>suspicious</strong>. He thought Atahualpa was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>exaggerating</strong>. But a few days later, Pizarro returned to the Inca palace with his <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>ambassadors</strong>. He saw a room filled with <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='16'>stacks </strong>of gold. There were golden <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>necklaces</strong>, cups, plates and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>vases</strong>. It was a great <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>spectacle</strong>. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>acknowledged </strong>that Atahualpa had told the truth. But after seeing the gold, he wanted all of Peru&rsquo;s gold. So he didn&rsquo;t leave the country.</p><p>The Spanish soldiers stayed in Peru and grabbed all the gold they could find. But the Inca people tricked the Spaniards. They mixed the gold with tin so that it was poor quality. They gave this gold to the Spaniards. <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>Meanwhile</strong>, they hid the good gold. They stuffed it into sacks and <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>dragged </strong>it deep into the jungle. The Spanish conquerors never found the gold. People think it is still there today.</p>",

His father worked as a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='3'>chemist </strong>for an <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='10'>institution </strong>and wanted Marcus to get a job there. Instead, the boy delivered milk. Each morning he took <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='6'>dairy </strong>products to the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='8'>grocers</strong>.</p><p>One day, Marcus was <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='11'>jogging </strong>down the street with a gallon of milk to give to a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='12'>merchant</strong>. He didn&rsquo;t want to be late. He ran down a path beside a large <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='2'>canal</strong>. A wall there kept water from coming into the town during high <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='18'>tide</strong>. But Marcus saw a small hole in the wall. Marcus knew that if the wall broke, it would be a <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='19'>tragedy </strong>for the town.</p><p>At first, he <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='9'>hesitated</strong>. He had to choose between helping himself and helping the town. There was only one way to save the town. It seemed crazy to him, but it was the only thing he could do. He <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='13'>poked </strong>his finger into the hole. This didn&rsquo;t fix the problem forever, but it did <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='14'>postpone </strong>the tragedy.</p><p>His finger <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='0'>ached</strong>. He felt the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='4'>chill </strong>of the <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='1'>arctic </strong>water as it <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='15'>splashed </strong>him. There was no one else around. He knew he had to wait until the tide <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='7'>descended</strong>. It was very difficult, but Marcus stayed there and saved the town.</p><p>Once the tide had descended, Marcus told everyone what happened. A group of people went to the wall. They saw the hole and fixed it. Everyone was very happy with Marcus. The local <strong class='idiom-tip' idx='5'>congress </strong>even gave him a gift for saving the town. He was a hero.</p>",
